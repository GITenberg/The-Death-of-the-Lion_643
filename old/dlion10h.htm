THE DEATH OF THE LION<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I had simply, I suppose, a change of heart, and it must have begun when
I received my manuscript back from Mr. Pinhorn.&nbsp; Mr. Pinhorn was
my &ldquo;chief,&rdquo; as he was called in the office: he had the high
mission of bringing the paper up.&nbsp; This was a weekly periodical,
which had been supposed to be almost past redemption when he took hold
of it.&nbsp; It was Mr. Deedy who had let the thing down so dreadfully:
he was never mentioned in the office now save in connexion with that
misdemeanour.&nbsp; Young as I was I had been in a manner taken over
from Mr. Deedy, who had been owner as well as editor; forming part of
a promiscuous lot, mainly plant and office-furniture, which poor Mrs.
Deedy, in her bereavement and depression, parted with at a rough valuation.&nbsp;
I could account for my continuity but on the supposition that I had
been cheap.&nbsp; I rather resented the practice of fathering all flatness
on my late protector, who was in his unhonoured grave; but as I had
my way to make I found matter enough for complacency in being on a &ldquo;staff.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At the same time I was aware of my exposure to suspicion as a product
of the old lowering system.&nbsp; This made me feel I was doubly bound
to have ideas, and had doubtless been at the bottom of my proposing
to Mr. Pinhorn that I should lay my lean hands on Neil Paraday.&nbsp;
I remember how he looked at me - quite, to begin with, as if he had
never heard of this celebrity, who indeed at that moment was by no means
in the centre of the heavens; and even when I had knowingly explained
he expressed but little confidence in the demand for any such stuff.&nbsp;
When I had reminded him that the great principle on which we were supposed
to work was just to create the demand we required, he considered a moment
and then returned: &ldquo;I see - you want to write him up.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Call it that if you like.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your inducement?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Bless my soul - my admiration!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Pinhorn pursed up his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there much to be done
with him?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Whatever there is we should have it all to ourselves, for he
hasn&rsquo;t been touched.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This argument was effective and Mr. Pinhorn responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
well, touch him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he added: &ldquo;But where can you
do it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Under the fifth rib!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Pinhorn stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You want me to go down and see him?&rdquo; I asked when I had
enjoyed his visible search for the obscure suburb I seemed to have named.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;want&rsquo; anything - the proposal&rsquo;s
your own.&nbsp; But you must remember that that&rsquo;s the way we do
things <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Pinhorn with another dig Mr. Deedy.<br>
<br>
Unregenerate as I was I could read the queer implications of this speech.&nbsp;
The present owner&rsquo;s superior virtue as well as his deeper craft
spoke in his reference to the late editor as one of that baser sort
who deal in false representations.&nbsp; Mr. Deedy would as soon have
sent me to call on Neil Paraday as he would have published a &ldquo;holiday-number&rdquo;;
but such scruples presented themselves as mere ignoble thrift to his
successor, whose own sincerity took the form of ringing door-bells and
whose definition of genius was the art of finding people at home.&nbsp;
It was as if Mr. Deedy had published reports without his young men&rsquo;s
having, as Pinhorn would have said, really been there.&nbsp; I was unregenerate,
as I have hinted, and couldn&rsquo;t be concerned to straighten out
the journalistic morals of my chief, feeling them indeed to be an abyss
over the edge of which it was better not to peer.&nbsp; Really to be
there this time moreover was a vision that made the idea of writing
something subtle about Neil Paraday only the more inspiring.&nbsp; I
would be as considerate as even Mr. Deedy could have wished, and yet
I should be as present as only Mr. Pinhorn could conceive.&nbsp; My
allusion to the sequestered manner in which Mr. Paraday lived - it had
formed part of my explanation, though I knew of it only by hearsay -
was, I could divine, very much what had made Mr. Pinhorn nibble.&nbsp;
It struck him as inconsistent with the success of his paper that any
one should be so sequestered as that.&nbsp; And then wasn&rsquo;t an
immediate exposure of everything just what the public wanted?&nbsp;
Mr. Pinhorn effectually called me to order by reminding me of the promptness
with which I had met Miss Braby at Liverpool on her return from her
fiasco in the States.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t we published, while its freshness
and flavour were unimpaired, Miss Braby&rsquo;s own version of that
great international episode?&nbsp; I felt somewhat uneasy at this lumping
of the actress and the author, and I confess that after having enlisted
Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s sympathies I procrastinated a little.&nbsp; I had
succeeded better than I wished, and I had, as it happened, work nearer
at hand.&nbsp; A few days later I called on Lord Crouchley and carried
off in triumph the most unintelligible statement that had yet appeared
of his lordship&rsquo;s reasons for his change of front.&nbsp; I thus
set in motion in the daily papers columns of virtuous verbiage.&nbsp;
The following week I ran down to Brighton for a chat, as Mr. Pinhorn
called it, with Mrs. Bounder, who gave me, on the subject of her divorce,
many curious particulars that had not been articulated in court.&nbsp;
If ever an article flowed from the primal fount it was that article
on Mrs. Bounder.&nbsp; By this time, however, I became aware that Neil
Paraday&rsquo;s new book was on the point of appearing and that its
approach had been the ground of my original appeal to Mr. Pinhorn, who
was now annoyed with me for having lost so many days.&nbsp; He bundled
me off - we would at least not lose another.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always
thought his sudden alertness a remarkable example of the journalistic
instinct.&nbsp; Nothing had occurred, since I first spoke to him, to
create a visible urgency, and no enlightenment could possibly have reached
him.&nbsp; It was a pure case of profession flair - he had smelt the
coming glory as an animal smells its distant prey.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I may as well say at once that this little record pretends in no degree
to be a picture either of my introduction to Mr. Paraday or of certain
proximate steps and stages.&nbsp; The scheme of my narrative allows
no space for these things, and in any case a prohibitory sentiment would
hang about my recollection of so rare an hour.&nbsp; These meagre notes
are essentially private, so that if they see the light the insidious
forces that, as my story itself shows, make at present for publicity
will simply have overmastered my precautions.&nbsp; The curtain fell
lately enough on the lamentable drama.&nbsp; My memory of the day I
alighted at Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s door is a fresh memory of kindness,
hospitality, compassion, and of the wonderful illuminating talk in which
the welcome was conveyed.&nbsp; Some voice of the air had taught me
the right moment, the moment of his life at which an act of unexpected
young allegiance might most come home to him.&nbsp; He had recently
recovered from a long, grave illness.&nbsp; I had gone to the neighbouring
inn for the night, but I spent the evening in his company, and he insisted
the next day on my sleeping under his roof.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t an
indefinite leave: Mr. Pinhorn supposed us to put our victims through
on the gallop.&nbsp; It was later, in the office, that the rude motions
of the jig were set to music.&nbsp; I fortified myself, however, as
my training had taught me to do, by the conviction that nothing could
be more advantageous for my article than to be written in the very atmosphere.&nbsp;
I said nothing to Mr. Paraday about it, but in the morning, after my
remove from the inn, while he was occupied in his study, as he had notified
me he should need to be, I committed to paper the main heads of my impression.&nbsp;
Then thinking to commend myself to Mr. Pinhorn by my celerity, I walked
out and posted my little packet before luncheon.&nbsp; Once my paper
was written I was free to stay on, and if it was calculated to divert
attention from my levity in so doing I could reflect with satisfaction
that I had never been so clever.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to deny of
course that I was aware it was much too good for Mr. Pinhorn; but I
was equally conscious that Mr. Pinhorn had the supreme shrewdness of
recognising from time to time the cases in which an article was not
too bad only because it was too good.&nbsp; There was nothing he loved
so much as to print on the right occasion a thing he hated.&nbsp; I
had begun my visit to the great man on a Monday, and on the Wednesday
his book came out.&nbsp; A copy of it arrived by the first post, and
he let me go out into the garden with it immediately after breakfast,
I read it from beginning to end that day, and in the evening he asked
me to remain with him the rest of the week and over the Sunday.<br>
<br>
That night my manuscript came back from Mr. Pinhorn, accompanied with
a letter the gist of which was the desire to know what I meant by trying
to fob off on him such stuff.&nbsp; That was the meaning of the question,
if not exactly its form, and it made my mistake immense to me.&nbsp;
Such as this mistake was I could now only look it in the face and accept
it.&nbsp; I knew where I had failed, but it was exactly where I couldn&rsquo;t
have succeeded.&nbsp; I had been sent down to be personal and then in
point of fact hadn&rsquo;t been personal at all: what I had dispatched
to London was just a little finicking feverish study of my author&rsquo;s
talent.&nbsp; Anything less relevant to Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s purpose
couldn&rsquo;t well be imagined, and he was visibly angry at my having
(at his expense, with a second-class ticket) approached the subject
of our enterprise only to stand off so helplessly.&nbsp; For myself,
I knew but too well what had happened, and how a miracle - as pretty
as some old miracle of legend - had been wrought on the spot to save
me.&nbsp; There had been a big brush of wings, the flash of an opaline
robe, and then, with a great cool stir of the air, the sense of an angel&rsquo;s
having swooped down and caught me to his bosom.&nbsp; He held me only
till the danger was over, and it all took place in a minute.&nbsp; With
my manuscript back on my hands I understood the phenomenon better, and
the reflexions I made on it are what I meant, at the beginning of this
anecdote, by my change of heart.&nbsp; Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s note was
not only a rebuke decidedly stern, but an invitation immediately to
send him - it was the case to say so - the genuine article, the revealing
and reverberating sketch to the promise of which, and of which alone,
I owed my squandered privilege.&nbsp; A week or two later I recast my
peccant paper and, giving it a particular application to Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s
new book, obtained for it the hospitality of another journal, where,
I must admit, Mr. Pinhorn was so far vindicated as that it attracted
not the least attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was frankly, at the end of three days, a very prejudiced critic, so
that one morning when, in the garden, my great man had offered to read
me something I quite held my breath as I listened.&nbsp; It was the
written scheme of another book - something put aside long ago, before
his illness, but that he had lately taken out again to reconsider.&nbsp;
He had been turning it round when I came down on him, and it had grown
magnificently under this second hand.&nbsp; Loose liberal confident,
it might have passed for a great gossiping eloquent letter - the overflow
into talk of an artist&rsquo;s amorous plan.&nbsp; The theme I thought
singularly rich, quite the strongest he had yet treated; and this familiar
statement of it, full too of fine maturities, was really, in summarised
splendour, a mine of gold, a precious independent work.&nbsp; I remember
rather profanely wondering whether the ultimate production could possibly
keep at the pitch.&nbsp; His reading of the fond epistle, at any rate,
made me feel as if I were, for the advantage of posterity, in close
correspondence with him - were the distinguished person to whom it had
been affectionately addressed.&nbsp; It was a high distinction simply
to be told such things.&nbsp; The idea he now communicated had all the
freshness, the flushed fairness, of the conception untouched and untried:
it was Venus rising from the sea and before the airs had blown upon
her.&nbsp; I had never been so throbbingly present at such an unveiling.&nbsp;
But when he had tossed the last bright word after the others, as I had
seen cashiers in banks, weighing mounds of coin, drop a final sovereign
into the tray, I knew a sudden prudent alarm.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dear master, how, after all, are you going to do it?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s infinitely noble, but what time it will take, what patience
and independence, what assured, what perfect conditions!&nbsp; Oh for
a lone isle in a tepid sea!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this practically a lone isle, and aren&rsquo;t you,
as an encircling medium, tepid enough?&rdquo; he asked, alluding with
a laugh to the wonder of my young admiration and the narrow limits of
his little provincial home.&nbsp; &ldquo;Time isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;ve
lacked hitherto: the question hasn&rsquo;t been to find it, but to use
it.&nbsp; Of course my illness made, while it lasted, a great hole -
but I dare say there would have been a hole at any rate.&nbsp; The earth
we tread has more pockets than a billiard-table.&nbsp; The great thing
is now to keep on my feet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I mean.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Neil Paraday looked at me with eyes - such pleasant eyes as he had -
in which, as I now recall their expression, I seem to have seen a dim
imagination of his fate.&nbsp; He was fifty years old, and his illness
had been cruel, his convalescence slow.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
as if I weren&rsquo;t all right.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh if you weren&rsquo;t all right I wouldn&rsquo;t look at you!&rdquo;
I tenderly said.<br>
<br>
We had both got up, quickened as by this clearer air, and he had lighted
a cigarette.&nbsp; I had taken a fresh one, which with an intenser smile,
by way of answer to my exclamation, he applied to the flame of his match.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I weren&rsquo;t better I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought of <i>that</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He flourished his script in his hand.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be discouraging, but that&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo;
I returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that during the months you lay
here in pain you had visitations sublime.&nbsp; You thought of a thousand
things.&nbsp; You think of more and more all the while.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what makes you, if you&rsquo;ll pardon my familiarity, so respectable.&nbsp;
At a time when so many people are spent you come into your second wind.&nbsp;
But, thank God, all the same, you&rsquo;re better!&nbsp; Thank God,
too, you&rsquo;re not, as you were telling me yesterday, &lsquo;successful.&rsquo;&nbsp;
If <i>you</i> weren&rsquo;t a failure what would be the use of trying?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s my one reserve on the subject of your recovery - that it
makes you &lsquo;score,&rsquo; as the newspapers say.&nbsp; It looks
well in the newspapers, and almost anything that does that&rsquo;s horrible.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We are happy to announce that Mr. Paraday, the celebrated author,
is again in the enjoyment of excellent health.&rsquo;&nbsp; Somehow
I shouldn&rsquo;t like to see it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see it; I&rsquo;m not in the least celebrated
- my obscurity protects me.&nbsp; But couldn&rsquo;t you bear even to
see I was dying or dead?&rdquo; my host enquired.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dead - passe encore; there&rsquo;s nothing so safe.&nbsp; One
never knows what a living artist may do - one has mourned so many.&nbsp;
However, one must make the worst of it.&nbsp; You must be as dead as
you can.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I meet that condition in having just published a
book?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Adequately, let us hope; for the book&rsquo;s verily a masterpiece.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At this moment the parlour-maid appeared in the door that opened from
the garden: Paraday lived at no great cost, and the frisk of petticoats,
with a timorous &ldquo;Sherry, sir?&rdquo; was about his modest mahogany.&nbsp;
He allowed half his income to his wife, from whom he had succeeded in
separating without redundancy of legend.&nbsp; I had a general faith
in his having behaved well, and I had once, in London, taken Mrs. Paraday
down to dinner.&nbsp; He now turned to speak to the maid, who offered
him, on a tray, some card or note, while, agitated, excited, I wandered
to the end of the precinct.&nbsp; The idea of his security became supremely
dear to me, and I asked myself if I were the same young man who had
come down a few days before to scatter him to the four winds.&nbsp;
When I retraced my steps he had gone into the house, and the woman -
the second London post had come in - had placed my letters and a newspaper
on a bench.&nbsp; I sat down there to the letters, which were a brief
business, and then, without heeding the address, took the paper from
its envelope.&nbsp; It was the journal of highest renown, <i>The Empire</i>
of that morning.&nbsp; It regularly came to Paraday, but I remembered
that neither of us had yet looked at the copy already delivered.&nbsp;
This one had a great mark on the &ldquo;editorial&rdquo; page, and,
uncrumpling the wrapper, I saw it to be directed to my host and stamped
with the name of his publishers.&nbsp; I instantly divined that <i>The
Empire</i> had spoken of him, and I&rsquo;ve not forgotten the odd little
shock of the circumstance.&nbsp; It checked all eagerness and made me
drop the paper a moment.&nbsp; As I sat there conscious of a palpitation
I think I had a vision of what was to be.&nbsp; I had also a vision
of the letter I would presently address to Mr. Pinhorn, breaking, as
it were, with Mr. Pinhorn.&nbsp; Of course, however, the next minute
the voice of <i>The Empire</i> was in my ears.<br>
<br>
The article wasn&rsquo;t, I thanked heaven, a review; it was a &ldquo;leader,&rdquo;
the last of three, presenting Neil Paraday to the human race.&nbsp;
His new book, the fifth from his hand, had been but a day or two out,
and <i>The Empire</i>, already aware of it, fired, as if on the birth
of a prince, a salute of a whole column.&nbsp; The guns had been booming
these three hours in the house without our suspecting them.&nbsp; The
big blundering newspaper had discovered him, and now he was proclaimed
and anointed and crowned.&nbsp; His place was assigned him as publicly
as if a fat usher with a wand had pointed to the topmost chair; he was
to pass up and still up, higher and higher, between the watching faces
and the envious sounds - away up to the dais and the throne.&nbsp; The
article was &ldquo;epoch-making,&rdquo; a landmark in his life; he had
taken rank at a bound, waked up a national glory.&nbsp; A national glory
was needed, and it was an immense convenience he was there.&nbsp; What
all this meant rolled over me, and I fear I grew a little faint - it
meant so much more than I could say &ldquo;yea&rdquo; to on the spot.&nbsp;
In a flash, somehow, all was different; the tremendous wave I speak
of had swept something away.&nbsp; It had knocked down, I suppose, my
little customary altar, my twinkling tapers and my flowers, and had
reared itself into the likeness of a temple vast and bare.&nbsp; When
Neil Paraday should come out of the house he would come out a contemporary.&nbsp;
That was what had happened: the poor man was to be squeezed into his
horrible age.&nbsp; I felt as if he had been overtaken on the crest
of the hill and brought back to the city.&nbsp; A little more and he
would have dipped down the short cut to posterity and escaped.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When he came out it was exactly as if he had been in custody, for beside
him walked a stout man with a big black beard, who, save that he wore
spectacles, might have been a policeman, and in whom at a second glance
I recognised the highest contemporary enterprise.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is Mr. Morrow,&rdquo; said Paraday, looking, I thought,
rather white: &ldquo;he wants to publish heaven knows what about me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I winced as I remembered that this was exactly what I myself had wanted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Already?&rdquo; I cried with a sort of sense that my friend had
fled to me for protection.<br>
<br>
Mr. Morrow glared, agreeably, through his glasses: they suggested the
electric headlights of some monstrous modem ship, and I felt as if Paraday
and I were tossing terrified under his bows.&nbsp; I saw his momentum
was irresistible.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was confident that I should be the
first in the field.&nbsp; A great interest is naturally felt in Mr.
Paraday&rsquo;s surroundings,&rdquo; he heavily observed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t the least idea of it,&rdquo; said Paraday, as
if he had been told he had been snoring.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I find he hasn&rsquo;t read the article in <i>The Empire</i>,&rdquo;
Mr. Morrow remarked to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so very interesting
- it&rsquo;s something to start with,&rdquo; he smiled.&nbsp; He had
begun to pull off his gloves, which were violently new, and to look
encouragingly round the little garden.&nbsp; As a &ldquo;surrounding&rdquo;
I felt how I myself had already been taken in; I was a little fish in
the stomach of a bigger one.&nbsp; &ldquo;I represent,&rdquo; our visitor
continued, &ldquo;a syndicate of influential journals, no less than
thirty-seven, whose public - whose publics, I may say - are in peculiar
sympathy with Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s line of thought.&nbsp; They would
greatly appreciate any expression of his views on the subject of the
art he so nobly exemplifies.&nbsp; In addition to my connexion with
the syndicate just mentioned I hold a particular commission from <i>The
Tatler</i>, whose most prominent department, &lsquo;Smatter and Chatter&rsquo;
- I dare say you&rsquo;ve often enjoyed it - attracts such attention.&nbsp;
I was honoured only last week, as a representative of <i>The Tatler</i>,
with the confidence of Guy Walsingham, the brilliant author of &lsquo;Obsessions.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She pronounced herself thoroughly pleased with my sketch of her method;
she went so far as to say that I had made her genius more comprehensible
even to herself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Neil Paraday had dropped on the garden-bench and sat there at once detached
and confounded; he looked hard at a bare spot in the lawn, as if with
an anxiety that had suddenly made him grave.&nbsp; His movement had
been interpreted by his visitor as an invitation to sink sympathetically
into a wicker chair that stood hard by, and while Mr. Morrow so settled
himself I felt he had taken official possession and that there was no
undoing it.&nbsp; One had heard of unfortunate people&rsquo;s having
&ldquo;a man in the house,&rdquo; and this was just what we had.&nbsp;
There was a silence of a moment, during which we seemed to acknowledge
in the only way that was possible the presence of universal fate; the
sunny stillness took no pity, and my thought, as I was sure Paraday&rsquo;s
was doing, performed within the minute a great distant revolution.&nbsp;
I saw just how emphatic I should make my rejoinder to Mr. Pinhorn, and
that having come, like Mr. Morrow, to betray, I must remain as long
as possible to save.&nbsp; Not because I had brought my mind back, but
because our visitors last words were in my ear, I presently enquired
with gloomy irrelevance if Guy Walsingham were a woman.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh yes, a mere pseudonym - rather pretty, isn&rsquo;t it? - and
convenient, you know, for a lady who goes in for the larger latitude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Obsessions, by Miss So-and-so,&rsquo; would look a little odd,
but men are more naturally indelicate.&nbsp; Have you peeped into &lsquo;Obsessions&rsquo;?&rdquo;
Mr. Morrow continued sociably to our companion.<br>
<br>
Paraday, still absent, remote, made no answer, as if he hadn&rsquo;t
heard the question: a form of intercourse that appeared to suit the
cheerful Mr. Morrow as well as any other.&nbsp; Imperturbably bland,
he was a man of resources - he only needed to be on the spot.&nbsp;
He had pocketed the whole poor place while Paraday and I were wool-gathering,
and I could imagine that he had already got his &ldquo;heads.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His system, at any rate, was justified by the inevitability with which
I replied, to save my friend the trouble: &ldquo;Dear no - he hasn&rsquo;t
read it.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t read such things!&rdquo; I unwarily
added.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Things that are <i>too</i> far over the fence, eh?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I was indeed a godsend to Mr. Morrow.&nbsp; It was the psychological
moment; it determined the appearance of his note-book, which, however,
he at first kept slightly behind him, even as the dentist approaching
his victim keeps the horrible forceps.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Paraday holds
with the good old proprieties - I see!&rdquo;&nbsp; And thinking of
the thirty-seven influential journals, I found myself, as I found poor
Paraday, helplessly assisting at the promulgation of this ineptitude.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point on which distinguished views are so acceptable
as on this question - raised perhaps more strikingly than ever by Guy
Walsingham - of the permissibility of the larger latitude.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
an appointment, precisely in connexion with it, next week, with Dora
Forbes, author of &lsquo;The Other Way Round,&rsquo; which everybody&rsquo;s
talking about.&nbsp; Has Mr. Paraday glanced at &lsquo;The Other Way
Round&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Morrow now frankly appealed to me.&nbsp;
I took on myself to repudiate the supposition, while our companion,
still silent, got up nervously and walked away.&nbsp; His visitor paid
no heed to his withdrawal; but opened out the note-book with a more
fatherly pat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dora Forbes, I gather, takes the ground,
the same as Guy Walsingham&rsquo;s, that the larger latitude has simply
got to come.&nbsp; He holds that it has got to be squarely faced.&nbsp;
Of course his sex makes him a less prejudiced witness.&nbsp; But an
authoritative word from Mr. Paraday - from the point of view of <i>his</i>
sex, you know - would go right round the globe.&nbsp; He takes the line
that we <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> got to face it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I was bewildered: it sounded somehow as if there were three sexes.&nbsp;
My interlocutor&rsquo;s pencil was poised, my private responsibility
great.&nbsp; I simply sat staring, none the less, and only found presence
of mind to say: &ldquo;Is this Miss Forbes a gentleman?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Morrow had a subtle smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be &lsquo;Miss&rsquo;
- there&rsquo;s a wife!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I mean is she a man?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The wife?&rdquo; - Mr. Morrow was for a moment as confused as
myself.&nbsp; But when I explained that I alluded to Dora Forbes in
person he informed me, with visible amusement at my being so out of
it, that this was the &ldquo;pen-name&rdquo; of an indubitable male
- he had a big red moustache.&nbsp; &ldquo;He goes in for the slight
mystification because the ladies are such popular favourites.&nbsp;
A great deal of interest is felt in his acting on that idea - which
<i>is</i> clever, isn&rsquo;t it? - and there&rsquo;s every prospect
of its being widely imitated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our host at this moment joined
us again, and Mr. Morrow remarked invitingly that he should be happy
to make a note of any observation the movement in question, the bid
for success under a lady&rsquo;s name, might suggest to Mr. Paraday.&nbsp;
But the poor man, without catching the allusion, excused himself, pleading
that, though greatly honoured by his visitor&rsquo;s interest, he suddenly
felt unwell and should have to take leave of him - have to go and lie
down and keep quiet.&nbsp; His young friend might be trusted to answer
for him, but he hoped Mr. Morrow didn&rsquo;t expect great things even
of his young friend.&nbsp; His young friend, at this moment, looked
at Neil Paraday with an anxious eye, greatly wondering if he were doomed
to be ill again; but Paraday&rsquo;s own kind face met his question
reassuringly, seemed to say in a glance intelligible enough: &ldquo;Oh
I&rsquo;m not ill, but I&rsquo;m scared: get him out of the house as
quietly as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Getting newspaper-men out of the house
was odd business for an emissary of Mr. Pinhorn, and I was so exhilarated
by the idea of it that I called after him as he left us: &ldquo;Read
the article in <i>The Empire</i> and you&rsquo;ll soon be all right!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Delicious my having come down to tell him of it!&rdquo; Mr. Morrow
ejaculated.&nbsp; &ldquo;My cab was at the door twenty minutes after
<i>The Empire</i> had been laid on my breakfast-table.&nbsp; Now what
have you got for me?&rdquo; he continued, dropping again into his chair,
from which, however, he the next moment eagerly rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was shown into the drawing-room, but there must be more to see - his
study, his literary sanctum, the little things he has about, or other
domestic objects and features.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t be lying down
on his study-table?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a great interest always felt
in the scene of an author&rsquo;s labours.&nbsp; Sometimes we&rsquo;re
favoured with very delightful peeps.&nbsp; Dora Forbes showed me all
his table-drawers, and almost jammed my hand into one into which I made
a dash!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ask that of you, but if we could talk things
over right there where he sits I feel as if I should get the keynote.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I had no wish whatever to be rude to Mr. Morrow, I was much too initiated
not to tend to more diplomacy; but I had a quick inspiration, and I
entertained an insurmountable, an almost superstitious objection to
his crossing the threshold of my friend&rsquo;s little lonely shabby
consecrated workshop.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no - we shan&rsquo;t get at his
life that way,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The way to get at his life
is to - But wait a moment!&rdquo;&nbsp; I broke off and went quickly
into the house, whence I in three minutes reappeared before Mr. Morrow
with the two volumes of Paraday&rsquo;s new book.&nbsp; &ldquo;His life&rsquo;s
here,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m so full of this admirable
thing that I can&rsquo;t talk of anything else.&nbsp; The artist&rsquo;s
life&rsquo;s his work, and this is the place to observe him.&nbsp; What
he has to tell us he tells us with <i>this</i> perfection.&nbsp; My
dear sir, the best interviewer is the best reader.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Morrow good-humouredly protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to say
that no other source of information should be open to us?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;None other till this particular one - by far the most copious
- has been quite exhausted.&nbsp; Have you exhausted it, my dear sir?&nbsp;
Had you exhausted it when you came down here?&nbsp; It seems to me in
our time almost wholly neglected, and something should surely be done
to restore its ruined credit.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the course to which the
artist himself at every step, and with such pathetic confidence, refers
us.&nbsp; This last book of Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s is full of revelations.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Revelations?&rdquo; panted Mr. Morrow, whom I had forced again
into his chair.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The only kind that count.&nbsp; It tells you with a perfection
that seems to me quite final all the author thinks, for instance, about
the advent of the &lsquo;larger latitude.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where does it do that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Morrow, who had picked
up the second volume and was insincerely thumbing it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Everywhere - in the whole treatment of his case.&nbsp; Extract
the opinion, disengage the answer - those are the real acts of homage.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Morrow, after a minute, tossed the book away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah but
you mustn&rsquo;t take me for a reviewer.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Heaven forbid I should take you for anything so dreadful!&nbsp;
You came down to perform a little act of sympathy, and so, I may confide
to you, did I.&nbsp; Let us perform our little act together.&nbsp; These
pages overflow with the testimony we want: let us read them and taste
them and interpret them.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll of course have perceived
for yourself that one scarcely does read Neil Paraday till one reads
him aloud; he gives out to the ear an extraordinary full tone, and it&rsquo;s
only when you expose it confidently to that test that you really get
near his style.&nbsp; Take up your book again and let me listen, while
you pay it out, to that wonderful fifteenth chapter.&nbsp; If you feel
you can&rsquo;t do it justice, compose yourself to attention while I
produce for you - I think I can! - this scarcely less admirable ninth.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Morrow gave me a straight look which was as hard as a blow between
the eyes; he had turned rather red, and a question had formed itself
in his mind which reached my sense as distinctly as if he had uttered
it: &ldquo;What sort of a damned fool are <i>you</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
he got up, gathering together his hat and gloves, buttoning his coat,
projecting hungrily all over the place the big transparency of his mask.&nbsp;
It seemed to flare over Fleet Street and somehow made the actual spot
distressingly humble: there was so little for it to feed on unless he
counted the blisters of our stucco or saw his way to do something with
the roses.&nbsp; Even the poor roses were common kinds.&nbsp; Presently
his eyes fell on the manuscript from which Paraday had been reading
to me and which still lay on the bench.&nbsp; As my own followed them
I saw it looked promising, looked pregnant, as if it gently throbbed
with the life the reader had given it.&nbsp; Mr. Morrow indulged in
a nod at it and a vague thrust of his umbrella.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a plan - a secret.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A secret!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was an instant&rsquo;s silence,
and then Mr. Morrow made another movement.&nbsp; I may have been mistaken,
but it affected me as the translated impulse of the desire to lay hands
on the manuscript, and this led me to indulge in a quick anticipatory
grab which may very well have seemed ungraceful, or even impertinent,
and which at any rate left Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s two admirers very erect,
glaring at each other while one of them held a bundle of papers well
behind him.&nbsp; An instant later Mr. Morrow quitted me abruptly, as
if he had really carried something off with him.&nbsp; To reassure myself,
watching his broad back recede, I only grasped my manuscript the tighter.&nbsp;
He went to the back door of the house, the one he had come out from,
but on trying the handle he appeared to find it fastened.&nbsp; So he
passed round into the front garden, and by listening intently enough
I could presently hear the outer gate close behind him with a bang.&nbsp;
I thought again of the thirty-seven influential journals and wondered
what would be his revenge.&nbsp; I hasten to add that he was magnanimous:
which was just the most dreadful thing he could have been.&nbsp; <i>The
Tatler</i> published a charming chatty familiar account of Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Home-life,&rdquo; and on the wings of the thirty-seven influential
journals it went, to use Mr. Morrow&rsquo;s own expression, right round
the globe.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A week later, early in May, my glorified friend came up to town, where,
it may be veraciously recorded he was the king of the beasts of the
year.&nbsp; No advancement was ever more rapid, no exaltation more complete,
no bewilderment more teachable.&nbsp; His book sold but moderately,
though the article in <i>The Empire</i> had done unwonted wonders for
it; but he circulated in person to a measure that the libraries might
well have envied.&nbsp; His formula had been found - he was a &ldquo;revelation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His momentary terror had been real, just as mine had been - the overclouding
of his passionate desire to be left to finish his work.&nbsp; He was
far from unsociable, but he had the finest conception of being let alone
that I&rsquo;ve ever met.&nbsp; For the time, none the less, he took
his profit where it seemed most to crowd on him, having in his pocket
the portable sophistries about the nature of the artist&rsquo;s task.&nbsp;
Observation too was a kind of work and experience a kind of success;
London dinners were all material and London ladies were fruitful toil.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No one has the faintest conception of what I&rsquo;m trying for,&rdquo;
he said to me, &ldquo;and not many have read three pages that I&rsquo;ve
written; but I must dine with them first - they&rsquo;ll find out why
when they&rsquo;ve time.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was rather rude justice perhaps;
but the fatigue had the merit of being a new sort, while the phantasmagoric
town was probably after all less of a battlefield than the haunted study.&nbsp;
He once told me that he had had no personal life to speak of since his
fortieth year, but had had more than was good for him before.&nbsp;
London closed the parenthesis and exhibited him in relations; one of
the most inevitable of these being that in which he found himself to
Mrs. Weeks Wimbush, wife of the boundless brewer and proprietress of
the universal menagerie.&nbsp; In this establishment, as everybody knows,
on occasions when the crush is great, the animals rub shoulders freely
with the spectators and the lions sit down for whole evenings with the
lambs.<br>
<br>
It had been ominously clear to me from the first that in Neil Paraday
this lady, who, as all the world agreed, was tremendous fun, considered
that she had secured a prime attraction, a creature of almost heraldic
oddity.&nbsp; Nothing could exceed her enthusiasm over her capture,
and nothing could exceed the confused apprehensions it excited in me.&nbsp;
I had an instinctive fear of her which I tried without effect to conceal
from her victim, but which I let her notice with perfect impunity.&nbsp;
Paraday heeded it, but she never did, for her conscience was that of
a romping child.&nbsp; She was a blind violent force to which I could
attach no more idea of responsibility than to the creaking of a sign
in the wind.&nbsp; It was difficult to say what she conduced to but
circulation.&nbsp; She was constructed of steel and leather, and all
I asked of her for our tractable friend was not to do him to death.&nbsp;
He had consented for a time to be of india-rubber, but my thoughts were
fixed on the day he should resume his shape or at least get back into
his box.&nbsp; It was evidently all right, but I should be glad when
it was well over.&nbsp; I had a special fear - the impression was ineffaceable
of the hour when, after Mr. Morrow&rsquo;s departure, I had found him
on the sofa in his study.&nbsp; That pretext of indisposition had not
in the least been meant as a snub to the envoy of <i>The Tatler</i>
- he had gone to lie down in very truth.&nbsp; He had felt a pang of
his old pain, the result of the agitation wrought in him by this forcing
open of a new period.&nbsp; His old programme, his old ideal even had
to be changed.&nbsp; Say what one would, success was a complication
and recognition had to be reciprocal.&nbsp; The monastic life, the pious
illumination of the missal in the convent cell were things of the gathered
past.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t engender despair, but at least it required
adjustment.&nbsp; Before I left him on that occasion we had passed a
bargain, my part of which was that I should make it my business to take
care of him.&nbsp; Let whoever would represent the interest in his presence
(I must have had a mystical prevision of Mrs. Weeks Wimbush) I should
represent the interest in his work - or otherwise expressed in his absence.&nbsp;
These two interests were in their essence opposed; and I doubt, as youth
is fleeting, if I shall ever again know the intensity of joy with which
I felt that in so good a cause I was willing to make myself odious.<br>
<br>
One day in Sloane Street I found myself questioning Paraday&rsquo;s
landlord, who had come to the door in answer to my knock.&nbsp; Two
vehicles, a barouche and a smart hansom, were drawn up before the house.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In the drawing-room, sir?&nbsp; Mrs. Weeks Wimbush.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And in the dining-room?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A young lady, sir - waiting: I think a foreigner.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was three o&rsquo;clock, and on days when Paraday didn&rsquo;t lunch
out he attached a value to these appropriated hours.&nbsp; On which
days, however, didn&rsquo;t the dear man lunch out?&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush,
at such a crisis, would have rushed round immediately after her own
repast.&nbsp; I went into the dining-room first, postponing the pleasure
of seeing how, upstairs, the lady of the barouche would, on my arrival,
point the moral of my sweet solicitude.&nbsp; No one took such an interest
as herself in his doing only what was good for him, and she was always
on the spot to see that he did it.&nbsp; She made appointments with
him to discuss the best means of economising his time and protecting
his privacy.&nbsp; She further made his health her special business,
and had so much sympathy with my own zeal for it that she was the author
of pleasing fictions on the subject of what my devotion had led me to
give up.&nbsp; I gave up nothing (I don&rsquo;t count Mr. Pinhorn) because
I had nothing, and all I had as yet achieved was to find myself also
in the menagerie.&nbsp; I had dashed in to save my friend, but I had
only got domesticated and wedged; so that I could do little more for
him than exchange with him over people&rsquo;s heads looks of intense
but futile intelligence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The young lady in the dining-room had a brave face, black hair, blue
eyes, and in her lap a big volume.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for
his autograph,&rdquo; she said when I had explained to her that I was
under bonds to see people for him when he was occupied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been waiting half an hour, but I&rsquo;m prepared to wait all day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know whether it was this that told me she was American,
for the propensity to wait all day is not in general characteristic
of her race.&nbsp; I was enlightened probably not so much by the spirit
of the utterance as by some quality of its sound.&nbsp; At any rate
I saw she had an individual patience and a lovely frock, together with
an expression that played among her pretty features like a breeze among
flowers.&nbsp; Putting her book on the table she showed me a massive
album, showily bound and full of autographs of price.&nbsp; The collection
of faded notes, of still more faded &ldquo;thoughts,&rdquo; of quotations,
platitudes, signatures, represented a formidable purpose.<br>
<br>
I could only disclose my dread of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most people apply
to Mr. Paraday by letter, you know.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, but he doesn&rsquo;t answer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve written three
times.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; I reflected; &ldquo;the sort of letter you
mean goes straight into the fire.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How do you know the sort I mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; My interlocutress
had blushed and smiled, and in a moment she added: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe he gets many like them!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re beautiful, but he burns without
reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t add that I had convinced him he
ought to.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he then in danger of burning things of importance?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He would perhaps be so if distinguished men hadn&rsquo;t an infallible
nose for nonsense.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She looked at me a moment - her face was sweet and gay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
<i>you</i> burn without reading too?&rdquo; - in answer to which I assured
her that if she&rsquo;d trust me with her repository I&rsquo;d see that
Mr. Paraday should write his name in it.<br>
<br>
She considered a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very well, but it
wouldn&rsquo;t make me see him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you want very much to see him?&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed ungracious
to catechise so charming a creature, but somehow I had never yet taken
my duty to the great author so seriously.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Enough to have come from America for the purpose.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;All alone?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that that&rsquo;s exactly your business, but
if it will make me more seductive I&rsquo;ll confess that I&rsquo;m
quite by myself.&nbsp; I had to come alone or not come at all.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She was interesting; I could imagine she had lost parents, natural protectors
- could conceive even she had inherited money.&nbsp; I was at a pass
of my own fortunes when keeping hansoms at doors seemed to me pure swagger.&nbsp;
As a trick of this bold and sensitive girl, however, it became romantic
- a part of the general romance of her freedom, her errand, her innocence.&nbsp;
The confidence of young Americans was notorious, and I speedily arrived
at a conviction that no impulse could have been more generous than the
impulse that had operated here.&nbsp; I foresaw at that moment that
it would make her my peculiar charge, just as circumstances had made
Neil Paraday.&nbsp; She would be another person to look after, so that
one&rsquo;s honour would be concerned in guiding her straight.&nbsp;
These things became clearer to me later on; at the instant I had scepticism
enough to observe to her, as I turned the pages of her volume, that
her net had all the same caught many a big fish.&nbsp; She appeared
to have had fruitful access to the great ones of the earth; there were
people moreover whose signatures she had presumably secured without
a personal interview.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t have worried George Washington
and Friedrich Schiller and Hannah More.&nbsp; She met this argument,
to my surprise, by throwing up the album without a pang.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t
even her own; she was responsible for none of its treasures.&nbsp; It
belonged to a girl-friend in America, a young lady in a western city.&nbsp;
This young lady had insisted on her bringing it, to pick up more autographs:
she thought they might like to see, in Europe, in what company they
would be.&nbsp; The &ldquo;girl-friend,&rdquo; the western city, the
immortal names, the curious errand, the idyllic faith, all made a story
as strange to me, and as beguiling, as some tale in the Arabian Nights.&nbsp;
Thus it was that my informant had encumbered herself with the ponderous
tome; but she hastened to assure me that this was the first time she
had brought it out.&nbsp; For her visit to Mr. Paraday it had simply
been a pretext.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t really care a straw that he should
write his name; what she did want was to look straight into his face.<br>
<br>
I demurred a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why do you require to do that?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Because I just love him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Before I could recover
from the agitating effect of this crystal ring my companion had continued:
&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t there ever been any face that you&rsquo;ve wanted
to look into?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
How could I tell her so soon how much I appreciated the opportunity
of looking into hers?&nbsp; I could only assent in general to the proposition
that there were certainly for every one such yearnings, and even such
faces; and I felt the crisis demand all my lucidity, all my wisdom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;m a student of physiognomy.&nbsp; Do you mean,&rdquo;
I pursued, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve a passion for Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s
books?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been everything to me and a little more beside
- I know them by heart.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve completely taken hold of
me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no author about whom I&rsquo;m in such a state
as I&rsquo;m in about Neil Paraday.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Permit me to remark then,&rdquo; I presently returned, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;re one of the right sort.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;One of the enthusiasts?&nbsp; Of course I am!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh there are enthusiasts who are quite of the wrong.&nbsp; I
mean you&rsquo;re one of those to whom an appeal can be made.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;An appeal?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her face lighted as if with the chance
of some great sacrifice.<br>
<br>
If she was ready for one it was only waiting for her, and in a moment
I mentioned it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give up this crude purpose of seeing him!&nbsp;
Go away without it.&nbsp; That will be far better.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She looked mystified, then turned visibly pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, hasn&rsquo;t
he any personal charm?&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl was terrible and laughable
in her bright directness.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah that dreadful word &lsquo;personally&rsquo;!&rdquo; I wailed;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re dying of it, for you women bring it out with murderous
effect.&nbsp; When you meet with a genius as fine as this idol of ours
let him off the dreary duty of being a personality as well.&nbsp; Know
him only by what&rsquo;s best in him and spare him for the same sweet
sake.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
My young lady continued to look at me in confusion and mistrust, and
the result of her reflexion on what I had just said was to make her
suddenly break out: &ldquo;Look here, sir - what&rsquo;s the matter
with him?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The matter with him is that if he doesn&rsquo;t look out people
will eat a great hole in his life.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She turned it over.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any disfigurement?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nothing to speak of!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you mean that social engagements interfere with his occupations?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That but feebly expresses it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So that he can&rsquo;t give himself up to his beautiful imagination?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s beset, badgered, bothered - he&rsquo;s pulled to pieces
on the pretext of being applauded.&nbsp; People expect him to give them
his time, his golden time, who wouldn&rsquo;t themselves give five shillings
for one of his books.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Five?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give five thousand!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Give your sympathy - give your forbearance.&nbsp; Two-thirds
of those who approach him only do it to advertise themselves.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed with the face
of an angel.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I was ever called
crude!&rdquo; she laughed.<br>
<br>
I followed up my advantage.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady with him
now who&rsquo;s a terrible complication, and who yet hasn&rsquo;t read,
I&rsquo;m sure, ten pages he ever wrote.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
My visitor&rsquo;s wide eyes grew tenderer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then how does
she talk - ?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Without ceasing.&nbsp; I only mention her as a single case.&nbsp;
Do you want to know how to show a superlative consideration?&nbsp; Simply
avoid him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Avoid him?&rdquo; she despairingly breathed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t force him to have to take account of you; admire
him in silence, cultivate him at a distance and secretly appropriate
his message.&nbsp; Do you want to know,&rdquo; I continued, warming
to my idea, &ldquo;how to perform an act of homage really sublime?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then as she hung on my words: &ldquo;Succeed in never seeing him at
all!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Never at all?&rdquo; - she suppressed a shriek for it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The more you get into his writings the less you&rsquo;ll want
to, and you&rsquo;ll be immensely sustained by the thought of the good
you&rsquo;re doing him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She looked at me without resentment or spite, and at the truth I had
put before her with candour, credulity, pity.&nbsp; I was afterwards
happy to remember that she must have gathered from my face the liveliness
of my interest in herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I see what you mean.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh I express it badly, but I should be delighted if you&rsquo;d
let me come to see you - to explain it better.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She made no response to this, and her thoughtful eyes fell on the big
album, on which she presently laid her hands as if to take it away.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I did use to say out West that they might write a little less
for autographs - to all the great poets, you know - and study the thoughts
and style a little more.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What do they care for the thoughts and style?&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t
even understand you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;that
I do myself, and I dare say that you by no means make me out.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She had got up to go, and though I wanted her to succeed in not seeing
Neil Paraday I wanted her also, inconsequently, to remain in the house.&nbsp;
I was at any rate far from desiring to hustle her off.&nbsp; As Mrs.
Weeks Wimbush, upstairs, was still saving our friend in her own way,
I asked my young lady to let me briefly relate, in illustration of my
point, the little incident of my having gone down into the country for
a profane purpose and been converted on the spot to holiness.&nbsp;
Sinking again into her chair to listen she showed a deep interest in
the anecdote.&nbsp; Then thinking it over gravely she returned with
her odd intonation: &ldquo;Yes, but you do see him!&rdquo; I had to
admit that this was the case; and I wasn&rsquo;t so prepared with an
effective attenuation as I could have wished.&nbsp; She eased the situation
off, however, by the charming quaintness with which she finally said:
&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t want him to be lonely!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
time she rose in earnest, but I persuaded her to let me keep the album
to show Mr. Paraday.&nbsp; I assured her I&rsquo;d bring it back to
her myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll find my address somewhere
in it on a paper!&rdquo; she sighed all resignedly at the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I blush to confess it, but I invited Mr. Paraday that very day to transcribe
into the album one of his most characteristic passages.&nbsp; I told
him how I had got rid of the strange girl who had brought it - her ominous
name was Miss Hurter and she lived at an hotel; quite agreeing with
him moreover as to the wisdom of getting rid with equal promptitude
of the book itself.&nbsp; This was why I carried it to Albemarle Street
no later than on the morrow.&nbsp; I failed to find her at home, but
she wrote to me and I went again; she wanted so much to hear more about
Neil Paraday.&nbsp; I returned repeatedly, I may briefly declare, to
supply her with this information.&nbsp; She had been immensely taken,
the more she thought of it, with that idea of mine about the act of
homage: it had ended by filling her with a generous rapture.&nbsp; She
positively desired to do something sublime for him, though indeed I
could see that, as this particular flight was difficult, she appreciated
the fact that my visits kept her up.&nbsp; I had it on my conscience
to keep her up: I neglected nothing that would contribute to it, and
her conception of our cherished author&rsquo;s independence became at
last as fine as his very own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Read him, read him - <i>that</i>
will be an education in decency,&rdquo; I constantly repeated; while,
seeking him in his works even as God in nature, she represented herself
as convinced that, according to my assurance, this was the system that
had, as she expressed it, weaned her.&nbsp; We read him together when
I could find time, and the generous creature&rsquo;s sacrifice was fed
by our communion.&nbsp; There were twenty selfish women about whom I
told her and who stirred her to a beautiful rage.&nbsp; Immediately
after my first visit her sister, Mrs. Milsom, came over from Paris,
and the two ladies began to present, as they called it, their letters.&nbsp;
I thanked our stars that none had been presented to Mr. Paraday.&nbsp;
They received invitations and dined out, and some of these occasions
enabled Fanny Hurter to perform, for consistency&rsquo;s sake, touching
feats of submission.&nbsp; Nothing indeed would now have induced her
even to look at the object of her admiration.&nbsp; Once, hearing his
name announced at a party, she instantly left the room by another door
and then straightway quitted the house.&nbsp; At another time when I
was at the opera with them - Mrs. Milsom had invited me to their box
- I attempted to point Mr. Paraday out to her in the stalls.&nbsp; On
this she asked her sister to change places with her and, while that
lady devoured the great man through a powerful glass, presented, all
the rest of the evening, her inspired back to the house.&nbsp; To torment
her tenderly I pressed the glass upon her, telling her how wonderfully
near it brought our friend&rsquo;s handsome head.&nbsp; By way of answer
she simply looked at me in charged silence, letting me see that tears
had gathered in her eyes.&nbsp; These tears, I may remark, produced
an effect on me of which the end is not yet.&nbsp; There was a moment
when I felt it my duty to mention them to Neil Paraday, but I was deterred
by the reflexion that there were questions more relevant to his happiness.<br>
<br>
These question indeed, by the end of the season, were reduced to a single
one - the question of reconstituting so far as might be possible the
conditions under which he had produced his best work.&nbsp; Such conditions
could never all come back, for there was a new one that took up too
much place; but some perhaps were not beyond recall.&nbsp; I wanted
above all things to see him sit down to the subject he had, on my making
his acquaintance, read me that admirable sketch of.&nbsp; Something
told me there was no security but in his doing so before the new factor,
as we used to say at Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s, should render the problem
incalculable.&nbsp; It only half-reassured me that the sketch itself
was so copious and so eloquent that even at the worst there would be
the making of a small but complete book, a tiny volume which, for the
faithful, might well become an object of adoration.&nbsp; There would
even not be wanting critics to declare, I foresaw, that the plan was
a thing to be more thankful for than the structure to have been reared
on it.&nbsp; My impatience for the structure, none the less, grew and
grew with the interruptions.&nbsp; He had on coming up to town begun
to sit for his portrait to a young painter, Mr. Rumble, whose little
game, as we also used to say at Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s, was to be the first
to perch on the shoulders of renown.&nbsp; Mr. Rumble&rsquo;s studio
was a circus in which the man of the hour, and still more the woman,
leaped through the hoops of his showy frames almost as electrically
as they burst into telegrams and &ldquo;specials.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pranced
into the exhibitions on their back; he was the reporter on canvas, the
Vandyke up to date, and there was one roaring year in which Mrs. Bounder
and Miss Braby, Guy Walsingham and Dora Forbes proclaimed in chorus
from the same pictured walls that no one had yet got ahead of him.<br>
<br>
Paraday had been promptly caught and saddled, accepting with characteristic
good-humour his confidential hint that to figure in his show was not
so much a consequence as a cause of immortality.&nbsp; From Mrs. Wimbush
to the last &ldquo;representative&rdquo; who called to ascertain his
twelve favourite dishes, it was the same ingenuous assumption that he
would rejoice in the repercussion.&nbsp; There were moments when I fancied
I might have had more patience with them if they hadn&rsquo;t been so
fatally benevolent.&nbsp; I hated at all events Mr. Rumble&rsquo;s picture,
and had my bottled resentment ready when, later on, I found my distracted
friend had been stuffed by Mrs. Wimbush into the mouth of another cannon.&nbsp;
A young artist in whom she was intensely interested, and who had no
connexion with Mr. Rumble, was to show how far he could make him go.&nbsp;
Poor Paraday, in return, was naturally to write something somewhere
about the young artist.&nbsp; She played her victims against each other
with admirable ingenuity, and her establishment was a huge machine in
which the tiniest and the biggest wheels went round to the same treadle.&nbsp;
I had a scene with her in which I tried to express that the function
of such a man was to exercise his genius - not to serve as a hoarding
for pictorial posters.&nbsp; The people I was perhaps angriest with
were the editors of magazines who had introduced what they called new
features, so aware were they that the newest feature of all would be
to make him grind their axes by contributing his views on vital topics
and taking part in the periodical prattle about the future of fiction.&nbsp;
I made sure that before I should have done with him there would scarcely
be a current form of words left me to be sick of; but meanwhile I could
make surer still of my animosity to bustling ladies for whom he drew
the water that irrigated their social flower-beds.<br>
<br>
I had a battle with Mrs. Wimbush over the artist she protected, and
another over the question of a certain week, at the end of July, that
Mr. Paraday appeared to have contracted to spend with her in the country.&nbsp;
I protested against this visit; I intimated that he was too unwell for
hospitality without a nuance, for caresses without imagination; I begged
he might rather take the time in some restorative way.&nbsp; A sultry
air of promises, of ponderous parties, hung over his August, and he
would greatly profit by the interval of rest.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t
told me he was ill again that he had had a warning; but I hadn&rsquo;t
needed this, for I found his reticence his worst symptom.&nbsp; The
only thing he said to me was that he believed a comfortable attack of
something or other would set him up: it would put out of the question
everything but the exemptions he prized.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
have presented him as a martyr in a very small cause if I fail to explain
that he surrendered himself much more liberally than I surrendered him.&nbsp;
He filled his lungs, for the most part; with the comedy of his queer
fate: the tragedy was in the spectacles through which I chose to look.&nbsp;
He was conscious of inconvenience, and above all of a great renouncement;
but how could he have heard a mere dirge in the bells of his accession?&nbsp;
The sagacity and the jealousy were mine, and his the impressions and
the harvest.&nbsp; Of course, as regards Mrs. Wimbush, I was worsted
in my encounters, for wasn&rsquo;t the state of his health the very
reason for his coming to her at Prestidge?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it precisely
at Prestidge that he was to be coddled, and wasn&rsquo;t the dear Princess
coming to help her to coddle him?&nbsp; The dear Princess, now on a
visit to England, was of a famous foreign house, and, in her gilded
cage, with her retinue of keepers and feeders, was the most expensive
specimen in the good lady&rsquo;s collection.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
her august presence had had to do with Paraday&rsquo;s consenting to
go, but it&rsquo;s not impossible he had operated as a bait to the illustrious
stranger.&nbsp; The party had been made up for him, Mrs. Wimbush averred,
and every one was counting on it, the dear Princess most of all.&nbsp;
If he was well enough he was to read them something absolutely fresh,
and it was on that particular prospect the Princess had set her heart.&nbsp;
She was so fond of genius in <i>any</i> walk of life, and was so used
to it and understood it so well: she was the greatest of Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s
admirers, she devoured everything he wrote.&nbsp; And then he read like
an angel.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush reminded me that he had again and again
given her, Mrs. Wimbush, the privilege of listening to him.<br>
<br>
I looked at her a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has he read to you?&rdquo;
I crudely enquired.<br>
<br>
For a moment too she met my eyes, and for the fraction of a moment she
hesitated and coloured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh all sorts of things!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I wondered if this were an imperfect recollection or only a perfect
fib, and she quite understood my unuttered comment on her measure of
such things.&nbsp; But if she could forget Neil Paraday&rsquo;s beauties
she could of course forget my rudeness, and three days later she invited
me, by telegraph, to join the party at Prestidge.&nbsp; This time she
might indeed have had a story about what I had given up to be near the
master.&nbsp; I addressed from that fine residence several communications
to a young lady in London, a young lady whom, I confess, I quitted with
reluctance and whom the reminder of what she herself could give up was
required to make me quit at all.&nbsp; It adds to the gratitude I owe
her on other grounds that she kindly allows me to transcribe from my
letters a few of the passages in which that hateful sojourn is candidly
commemorated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I suppose I ought to enjoy the joke of what&rsquo;s going on
here,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;but somehow it doesn&rsquo;t amuse me.&nbsp;
Pessimism on the contrary possesses me and cynicism deeply engages.&nbsp;
I positively feel my own flesh sore from the brass nails in Neil Paraday&rsquo;s
social harness.&nbsp; The house is full of people who like him, as they
mention, awfully, and with whom his talent for talking nonsense has
prodigious success.&nbsp; I delight in his nonsense myself; why is it
therefore that I grudge these happy folk their artless satisfaction?&nbsp;
Mystery of the human heart - abyss of the critical spirit!&nbsp; Mrs.
Wimbush thinks she can answer that question, and as my want of gaiety
has at last worn out her patience she has given me a glimpse of her
shrewd guess.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m made restless by the selfishness of the
insincere friend - I want to monopolise Paraday in order that he may
push me on.&nbsp; To be intimate with him is a feather in my cap; it
gives me an importance that I couldn&rsquo;t naturally pretend to, and
I seek to deprive him of social refreshment because I fear that meeting
more disinterested people may enlighten him as to my real motive.&nbsp;
All the disinterested people here are his particular admirers and have
been carefully selected as such.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s supposed to be
a copy of his last book in the house, and in the hall I come upon ladies,
in attitudes, bending gracefully over the first volume.&nbsp; I discreetly
avert my eyes, and when I next look round the precarious joy has been
superseded by the book of life.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a sociable circle
or a confidential couple, and the relinquished volume lies open on its
face and as dropped under extreme coercion.&nbsp; Somebody else presently
finds it and transfers it, with its air of momentary desolation, to
another piece of furniture.&nbsp; Every one&rsquo;s asking every one
about it all day, and every one&rsquo;s telling every one where they
put it last.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s rather smudgy about the
twentieth page.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a strong impression, too, that the
second volume is lost - has been packed in the bag of some departing
guest; and yet everybody has the impression that somebody else has read
to the end.&nbsp; You see therefore that the beautiful book plays a
great part in our existence.&nbsp; Why should I take the occasion of
such distinguished honours to say that I begin to see deeper into Gustave
Flaubert&rsquo;s doleful refrain about the hatred of literature?&nbsp;
I refer you again to the perverse constitution of man.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The Princess is a massive lady with the organisation of an athlete
and the confusion of tongues of a valet de place.&nbsp; She contrives
to commit herself extraordinarily little in a great many languages,
and is entertained and conversed with in detachments and relays, like
an institution which goes on from generation to generation or a big
building contracted for under a forfeit.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t have
a personal taste any more than, when her husband succeeds, she can have
a personal crown, and her opinion on any matter is rusty and heavy and
plain - made, in the night of ages, to last and be transmitted.&nbsp;
I feel as if I ought to &lsquo;tip&rsquo; some custode for my glimpse
of it.&nbsp; She has been told everything in the world and has never
perceived anything, and the echoes of her education respond awfully
to the rash footfall - I mean the casual remark - in the cold Valhalla
of her memory.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush delights in her wit and says there&rsquo;s
nothing so charming as to hear Mr. Paraday draw it out.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
perpetually detailed for this job, and he tells me it has a peculiarly
exhausting effect.&nbsp; Every one&rsquo;s beginning - at the end of
two days - to sidle obsequiously away from her, and Mrs. Wimbush pushes
him again and again into the breach.&nbsp; None of the uses I have yet
seen him put to infuriate me quite so much.&nbsp; He looks very fagged
and has at last confessed to me that his condition makes him uneasy
- has even promised me he&rsquo;ll go straight home instead of returning
to his final engagements in town.&nbsp; Last night I had some talk with
him about going to-day, cutting his visit short; so sure am I that he&rsquo;ll
be better as soon as he&rsquo;s shut up in his lighthouse.&nbsp; He
told me that this is what he would like to do; reminding me, however,
that the first lesson of his greatness has been precisely that he can&rsquo;t
do what he likes.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush would never forgive him if he should
leave her before the Princess has received the last hand.&nbsp; When
I hint that a violent rupture with our hostess would be the best thing
in the world for him he gives me to understand that if his reason assents
to the proposition his courage hangs woefully back.&nbsp; He makes no
secret of being mortally afraid of her, and when I ask what harm she
can do him that she hasn&rsquo;t already done he simply repeats: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid, I&rsquo;m afraid!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t enquire too closely,&rsquo;
he said last night; &lsquo;only believe that I feel a sort of terror.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s strange, when she&rsquo;s so kind!&nbsp; At any rate, I&rsquo;d
as soon overturn that piece of priceless S&egrave;vres as tell her I
must go before my date.&rsquo;&nbsp; It sounds dreadfully weak, but
he has some reason, and he pays for his imagination, which puts him
(I should hate it) in the place of others and makes him feel, even against
himself, their feelings, their appetites, their motives.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
indeed inveterately against himself that he makes his imagination act.&nbsp;
What a pity he has such a lot of it!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s too beastly intelligent.&nbsp;
Besides, the famous reading&rsquo;s still to come off, and it has been
postponed a day to allow Guy Walsingham to arrive.&nbsp; It appears
this eminent lady&rsquo;s staying at a house a few miles off, which
means of course that Mrs. Wimbush has forcibly annexed her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
to come over in a day or two - Mrs. Wimbush wants her to hear Mr. Paraday.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To-day&rsquo;s wet and cold, and several of the company, at the
invitation of the Duke, have driven over to luncheon at Bigwood.&nbsp;
I saw poor Paraday wedge himself, by command, into the little supplementary
seat of a brougham in which the Princess and our hostess were already
ensconced.&nbsp; If the front glass isn&rsquo;t open on his dear old
back perhaps he&rsquo;ll survive.&nbsp; Bigwood, I believe, is very
grand and frigid, all marble and precedence, and I wish him well out
of the adventure.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you how much more and more
your attitude to him, in the midst of all this, shines out by contrast.&nbsp;
I never willingly talk to these people about him, but see what a comfort
I find it to scribble to you!&nbsp; I appreciate it - it keeps me warm;
there are no fires in the house.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush goes by the calendar,
the temperature goes by the weather, the weather goes by God knows what,
and the Princess is easily heated.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve nothing but my acrimony
to warm me, and have been out under an umbrella to restore my circulation.&nbsp;
Coming in an hour ago I found Lady Augusta Minch rummaging about the
hall.&nbsp; When I asked her what she was looking for she said she had
mislaid something that Mr. Paraday had lent her.&nbsp; I ascertained
in a moment that the article in question is a manuscript, and I&rsquo;ve
a foreboding that it&rsquo;s the noble morsel he read me six weeks ago.&nbsp;
When I expressed my surprise that he should have bandied about anything
so precious (I happen to know it&rsquo;s his only copy - in the most
beautiful hand in all the world) Lady Augusta confessed to me that she
hadn&rsquo;t had it from himself, but from Mrs. Wimbush, who had wished
to give her a glimpse of it as a salve for her not being able to stay
and hear it read.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that the piece he&rsquo;s to read,&rsquo; I asked,
&lsquo;when Guy Walsingham arrives?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not for Guy Walsingham they&rsquo;re waiting
now, it&rsquo;s for Dora Forbes,&rsquo; Lady Augusta said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
coming, I believe, early to-morrow.&nbsp; Meanwhile Mrs. Wimbush has
found out about him, and is actively wiring to him.&nbsp; She says he
also must hear him.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;You bewilder me a little,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;in
the age we live in one gets lost among the genders and the pronouns.&nbsp;
The clear thing is that Mrs. Wimbush doesn&rsquo;t guard such a treasure
so jealously as she might.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Poor dear, she has the Princess to guard!&nbsp; Mr. Paraday
lent her the manuscript to look over.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;She spoke, you mean, as if it were the morning paper?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lady Augusta stared - my irony was lost on her.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
didn&rsquo;t have time, so she gave me a chance first; because unfortunately
I go to-morrow to Bigwood.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And your chance has only proved a chance to lose it?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost it.&nbsp; I remember now - it was
very stupid of me to have forgotten.&nbsp; I told my maid to give it
to Lord Dorimont - or at least to his man.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And Lord Dorimont went away directly after luncheon.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course he gave it back to my maid - or else his man
did,&rsquo; said Lady Augusta.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dare say it&rsquo;s all
right.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The conscience of these people is like a summer sea.&nbsp; They
haven&rsquo;t time to look over a priceless composition; they&rsquo;ve
only time to kick it about the house.&nbsp; I suggested that the &lsquo;man,&rsquo;
fired with a noble emulation, had perhaps kept the work for his own
perusal; and her ladyship wanted to know whether, if the thing shouldn&rsquo;t
reappear for the grand occasion appointed by our hostess, the author
wouldn&rsquo;t have something else to read that would do just as well.&nbsp;
Their questions are too delightful!&nbsp; I declared to Lady Augusta
briefly that nothing in the world can ever do so well as the thing that
does best; and at this she looked a little disconcerted.&nbsp; But I
added that if the manuscript had gone astray our little circle would
have the less of an effort of attention to make.&nbsp; The piece in
question was very long - it would keep them three hours.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Three hours!&nbsp; Oh the Princess will get up!&rsquo;
said Lady Augusta.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought she was Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s greatest admirer.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I dare say she is - she&rsquo;s so awfully clever.&nbsp;
But what&rsquo;s the use of being a Princess - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t dissemble your love?&rsquo; I asked
as Lady Augusta was vague.&nbsp; She said at any rate she&rsquo;d question
her maid; and I&rsquo;m hoping that when I go down to dinner I shall
find the manuscript has been recovered.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It has <i>not</i> been recovered,&rdquo; I wrote early the next
day, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m moreover much troubled about our friend.&nbsp;
He came back from Bigwood with a chill and, being allowed to have a
fire in his room, lay down a while before dinner.&nbsp; I tried to send
him to bed and indeed thought I had put him in the way of it; but after
I had gone to dress Mrs. Wimbush came up to see him, with the inevitable
result that when I returned I found him under arms and flushed and feverish,
though decorated with the rare flower she had brought him for his button-hole.&nbsp;
He came down to dinner, but Lady Augusta Minch was very shy of him.&nbsp;
To-day he&rsquo;s in great pain, and the advent of ces dames - I mean
of Guy Walsingham and Dora Forbes - doesn&rsquo;t at all console me.&nbsp;
It does Mrs. Wimbush, however, for she has consented to his remaining
in bed so that he may be all right to-morrow for the listening circle.&nbsp;
Guy Walsingham&rsquo;s already on the scene, and the Doctor for Paraday
also arrived early.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t yet seen the author of &lsquo;Obsessions,&rsquo;
but of course I&rsquo;ve had a moment by myself with the Doctor.&nbsp;
I tried to get him to say that our invalid must go straight home - I
mean to-morrow or next day; but he quite refuses to talk about the future.&nbsp;
Absolute quiet and warmth and the regular administration of an important
remedy are the points he mainly insists on.&nbsp; He returns this afternoon,
and I&rsquo;m to go back to see the patient at one o&rsquo;clock, when
he next takes his medicine.&nbsp; It consoles me a little that he certainly
won&rsquo;t be able to read - an exertion he was already more than unfit
for.&nbsp; Lady Augusta went off after breakfast, assuring me her first
care would be to follow up the lost manuscript.&nbsp; I can see she
thinks me a shocking busybody and doesn&rsquo;t understand my alarm,
but she&rsquo;ll do what she can, for she&rsquo;s a good-natured woman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So are they all honourable men.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was precisely
what made her give the thing to Lord Dorimont and made Lord Dorimont
bag it.&nbsp; What use <i>he</i> has for it God only knows.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
the worst forebodings, but somehow I&rsquo;m strangely without passion
- desperately calm.&nbsp; As I consider the unconscious, the well-meaning
ravages of our appreciative circle I bow my head in submission to some
great natural, some universal accident; I&rsquo;m rendered almost indifferent,
in fact quite gay (ha-ha!) by the sense of immitigable fate.&nbsp; Lady
Augusta promises me to trace the precious object and let me have it
through the post by the time Paraday&rsquo;s well enough to play his
part with it.&nbsp; The last evidence is that her maid did give it to
his lordship&rsquo;s valet.&nbsp; One would suppose it some thrilling
number of <i>The Family Budget</i>.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush, who&rsquo;s
aware of the accident, is much less agitated by it than she would doubtless
be were she not for the hour inevitably engrossed with Guy Walsingham.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Later in the day I informed my correspondent, for whom indeed I kept
a loose diary of the situation, that I had made the acquaintance of
this celebrity and that she was a pretty little girl who wore her hair
in what used to be called a crop.&nbsp; She looked so juvenile and so
innocent that if, as Mr. Morrow had announced, she was resigned to the
larger latitude, her superiority to prejudice must have come to her
early.&nbsp; I spent most of the day hovering about Neil Paraday&rsquo;s
room, but it was communicated to me from below that Guy Walsingham,
at Prestidge, was a success.&nbsp; Toward evening I became conscious
somehow that her superiority was contagious, and by the time the company
separated for the night I was sure the larger latitude had been generally
accepted.&nbsp; I thought of Dora Forbes and felt that he had no time
to lose.&nbsp; Before dinner I received a telegram from Lady Augusta
Minch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord Dorimont thinks he must have left bundle in
train - enquire.&rdquo;&nbsp; How could I enquire - if I was to take
the word as a command?&nbsp; I was too worried and now too alarmed about
Neil Paraday.&nbsp; The Doctor came back, and it was an immense satisfaction
to me to be sure he was wise and interested.&nbsp; He was proud of being
called to so distinguished a patient, but he admitted to me that night
that my friend was gravely ill.&nbsp; It was really a relapse, a recrudescence
of his old malady.&nbsp; There could be no question of moving him: we
must at any rate see first, on the spot, what turn his condition would
take.&nbsp; Meanwhile, on the morrow, he was to have a nurse.&nbsp;
On the morrow the dear man was easier, and my spirits rose to such cheerfulness
that I could almost laugh over Lady Augusta&rsquo;s second telegram:
&ldquo;Lord Dorimont&rsquo;s servant been to station - nothing found.&nbsp;
Push enquiries.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did laugh, I&rsquo;m sure, as I remembered
this to be the mystic scroll I had scarcely allowed poor Mr. Morrow
to point his umbrella at.&nbsp; Fool that I had been: the thirty-seven
influential journals wouldn&rsquo;t have destroyed it, they&rsquo;d
only have printed it.&nbsp; Of course I said nothing to Paraday.<br>
<br>
When the nurse arrived she turned me out of the room, on which I went
downstairs.&nbsp; I should premise that at breakfast the news that our
brilliant friend was doing well excited universal complacency, and the
Princess graciously remarked that he was only to be commiserated for
missing the society of Miss Collop.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush, whose social
gift never shone brighter than in the dry decorum with which she accepted
this fizzle in her fireworks, mentioned to me that Guy Walsingham had
made a very favourable impression on her Imperial Highness.&nbsp; Indeed
I think every one did so, and that, like the money-market or the national
honour, her Imperial Highness was constitutionally sensitive.&nbsp;
There was a certain gladness, a perceptible bustle in the air, however,
which I thought slightly anomalous in a house where a great author lay
critically ill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Le roy est mort - vive le roy&rdquo;: I
was reminded that another great author had already stepped into his
shoes.&nbsp; When I came down again after the nurse had taken possession
I found a strange gentleman hanging about the hall and pacing to and
fro by the closed door of the drawing-room.&nbsp; This personage was
florid and bald; he had a big red moustache and wore showy knickerbockers
- characteristics all that fitted to my conception of the identity of
Dora Forbes.&nbsp; In a moment I saw what had happened: the author of
&ldquo;The Other Way Round&rdquo; had just alighted at the portals of
Prestidge, but had suffered a scruple to restrain him from penetrating
further.&nbsp; I recognised his scruple when, pausing to listen at his
gesture of caution, I heard a shrill voice lifted in a sort of rhythmic
uncanny chant.&nbsp; The famous reading had begun, only it was the author
of &ldquo;Obsessions&rdquo; who now furnished the sacrifice.&nbsp; The
new visitor whispered to me that he judged something was going on he
oughtn&rsquo;t to interrupt.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Miss Collop arrived last night,&rdquo; I smiled, &ldquo;and the
Princess has a thirst for the in&eacute;dit.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Dora Forbes lifted his bushy brows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Collop?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Guy Walsingham, your distinguished confr&egrave;re - or shall
I say your formidable rival?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; growled Dora Forbes.&nbsp; Then he added: &ldquo;Shall
I spoil it if I go in?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I should think nothing could spoil it!&rdquo; I ambiguously laughed.<br>
<br>
Dora Forbes evidently felt the dilemma; he gave an irritated crook to
his moustache.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Shall</i> I go in?&rdquo; he presently
asked.<br>
<br>
We looked at each other hard a moment; then I expressed something bitter
that was in me, expressed it in an infernal &ldquo;Do!&rdquo;&nbsp;
After this I got out into the air, but not so fast as not to hear, when
the door of the drawing-room opened, the disconcerted drop of Miss Collop&rsquo;s
public manner: she must have been in the midst of the larger latitude.&nbsp;
Producing with extreme rapidity, Guy Walsingham has just published a
work in which amiable people who are not initiated have been pained
to see the genius of a sister-novelist held up to unmistakeable ridicule;
so fresh an exhibition does it seem to them of the dreadful way men
have always treated women.&nbsp; Dora Forbes, it&rsquo;s true, at the
present hour, is immensely pushed by Mrs. Wimbush and has sat for his
portrait to the young artists she protects, sat for it not only in oils
but in monumental alabaster.<br>
<br>
What happened at Prestidge later in the day is of course contemporary
history.&nbsp; If the interruption I had whimsically sanctioned was
almost a scandal, what is to be said of that general scatter of the
company which, under the Doctor&rsquo;s rule, began to take place in
the evening?&nbsp; His rule was soothing to behold, small comfort as
I was to have at the end.&nbsp; He decreed in the interest of his patient
an absolutely soundless house and a consequent break-up of the party.&nbsp;
Little country practitioner as he was, he literally packed off the Princess.&nbsp;
She departed as promptly as if a revolution had broken out, and Guy
Walsingham emigrated with her.&nbsp; I was kindly permitted to remain,
and this was not denied even to Mrs. Wimbush.&nbsp; The privilege was
withheld indeed from Dora Forbes; so Mrs. Wimbush kept her latest capture
temporarily concealed.&nbsp; This was so little, however, her usual
way of dealing with her eminent friends that a couple of days of it
exhausted her patience, and she went up to town with him in great publicity.&nbsp;
The sudden turn for the worse her afflicted guest had, after a brief
improvement, taken on the third night raised an obstacle to her seeing
him before her retreat; a fortunate circumstance doubtless, for she
was fundamentally disappointed in him.&nbsp; This was not the kind of
performance for which she had invited him to Prestidge, let alone invited
the Princess.&nbsp; I must add that none of the generous acts marking
her patronage of intellectual and other merit have done so much for
her reputation as her lending Neil Paraday the most beautiful of her
numerous homes to die in.&nbsp; He took advantage to the utmost of the
singular favour.&nbsp; Day by day I saw him sink, and I roamed alone
about the empty terraces and gardens.&nbsp; His wife never came near
him, but I scarcely noticed it: as I paced there with rage in my heart
I was too full of another wrong.&nbsp; In the event of his death it
would fall to me perhaps to bring out in some charming form, with notes,
with the tenderest editorial care, that precious heritage of his written
project.&nbsp; But where was that precious heritage and were both the
author and the book to have been snatched from us?&nbsp; Lady Augusta
wrote me that she had done all she could and that poor Lord Dorimont,
who had really been worried to death, was extremely sorry.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
have the matter out with Mrs. Wimbush, for I didn&rsquo;t want to be
taunted by her with desiring to aggrandise myself by a public connexion
with Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s sweepings.&nbsp; She had signified her willingness
to meet the expense of all advertising, as indeed she was always ready
to do.&nbsp; The last night of the horrible series, the night before
he died, I put my ear closer to his pillow.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That thing I read you that morning, you know.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In your garden that dreadful day?&nbsp; Yes!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it do as it is?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It would have been a glorious book.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a glorious book,&rdquo; Neil Paraday murmured.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Print it as it stands - beautifully.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Beautifully!&rdquo; I passionately promised.<br>
<br>
It may be imagined whether, now that he&rsquo;s gone, the promise seems
to me less sacred.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m convinced that if such pages had
appeared in his lifetime the Abbey would hold him to-day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
kept the advertising in my own hands, but the manuscript has not been
recovered.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s impossible, and at any rate intolerable,
to suppose it can have been wantonly destroyed.&nbsp; Perhaps some hazard
of a blind hand, some brutal fatal ignorance has lighted kitchen-fires
with it.&nbsp; Every stupid and hideous accident haunts my meditations.&nbsp;
My undiscourageable search for the lost treasure would make a long chapter.&nbsp;
Fortunately I&rsquo;ve a devoted associate in the person of a young
lady who has every day a fresh indignation and a fresh idea, and who
maintains with intensity that the prize will still turn up.&nbsp; Sometimes
I believe her, but I&rsquo;ve quite ceased to believe myself.&nbsp;
The only thing for us at all events is to go on seeking and hoping together;
and we should be closely united by this firm tie even were we not at
present by another.<br>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart

under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
