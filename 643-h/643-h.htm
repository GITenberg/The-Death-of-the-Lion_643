<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>I had simply, I suppose, a change of heart, and it must have
begun when I received my manuscript back from Mr. Pinhorn.&nbsp;
Mr. Pinhorn was my &ldquo;chief,&rdquo; as he was called in the
office: he had the high mission of bringing the paper up.&nbsp;
This was a weekly periodical, which had been supposed to be
almost past redemption when he took hold of it.&nbsp; It was Mr.
Deedy who had let the thing down so dreadfully: he was never
mentioned in the office now save in connexion with that
misdemeanour.&nbsp; Young as I was I had been in a manner taken
over from Mr. Deedy, who had been owner as well as editor;
forming part of a promiscuous lot, mainly plant and
office-furniture, which poor Mrs. Deedy, in her bereavement and
depression, parted with at a rough valuation.&nbsp; I could
account for my continuity but on the supposition that I had been
cheap.&nbsp; I rather resented the practice of fathering all
flatness on my late protector, who was in his unhonoured grave;
but as I had my way to make I found matter enough for complacency
in being on a &ldquo;staff.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same time I was
aware of my exposure to suspicion as a product of the old
lowering system.&nbsp; This made me feel I was doubly bound to
have ideas, and had doubtless been at the bottom of my proposing
to Mr. Pinhorn that I should lay my lean hands on Neil
Paraday.&nbsp; I remember how he looked at me&mdash;quite, to
begin with, as if he had never heard of this celebrity, who
indeed at that moment was by no means in the centre of the
heavens; and even when I had knowingly explained he expressed but
little confidence in the demand for any such stuff.&nbsp; When I
had reminded him that the great principle on which we were
supposed to work was just to create the demand we required, he
considered a moment and then returned: &ldquo;I see&mdash;you
want to write him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it that if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your inducement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul&mdash;my admiration!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pinhorn pursed up his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there much to
be done with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever there is we should have it all to ourselves,
for he hasn&rsquo;t been touched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This argument was effective and Mr. Pinhorn responded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very well, touch him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he added:
&ldquo;But where can you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the fifth rib!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pinhorn stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to go down and see him?&rdquo; I asked when
I had enjoyed his visible search for the obscure suburb I seemed
to have named.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;want&rsquo; anything&mdash;the
proposal&rsquo;s your own.&nbsp; But you must remember that
that&rsquo;s the way we do things <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pinhorn with another dig Mr. Deedy.</p>
<p>Unregenerate as I was I could read the queer implications of
this speech.&nbsp; The present owner&rsquo;s superior virtue as
well as his deeper craft spoke in his reference to the late
editor as one of that baser sort who deal in false
representations.&nbsp; Mr. Deedy would as soon have sent me to
call on Neil Paraday as he would have published a
&ldquo;holiday-number&rdquo;; but such scruples presented
themselves as mere ignoble thrift to his successor, whose own
sincerity took the form of ringing door-bells and whose
definition of genius was the art of finding people at home.&nbsp;
It was as if Mr. Deedy had published reports without his young
men&rsquo;s having, as Pinhorn would have said, really been
there.&nbsp; I was unregenerate, as I have hinted, and
couldn&rsquo;t be concerned to straighten out the journalistic
morals of my chief, feeling them indeed to be an abyss over the
edge of which it was better not to peer.&nbsp; Really to be there
this time moreover was a vision that made the idea of writing
something subtle about Neil Paraday only the more
inspiring.&nbsp; I would be as considerate as even Mr. Deedy
could have wished, and yet I should be as present as only Mr.
Pinhorn could conceive.&nbsp; My allusion to the sequestered
manner in which Mr. Paraday lived&mdash;it had formed part of my
explanation, though I knew of it only by hearsay&mdash;was, I
could divine, very much what had made Mr. Pinhorn nibble.&nbsp;
It struck him as inconsistent with the success of his paper that
any one should be so sequestered as that.&nbsp; And then
wasn&rsquo;t an immediate exposure of everything just what the
public wanted?&nbsp; Mr. Pinhorn effectually called me to order
by reminding me of the promptness with which I had met Miss Braby
at Liverpool on her return from her fiasco in the States.&nbsp;
Hadn&rsquo;t we published, while its freshness and flavour were
unimpaired, Miss Braby&rsquo;s own version of that great
international episode?&nbsp; I felt somewhat uneasy at this
lumping of the actress and the author, and I confess that after
having enlisted Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s sympathies I procrastinated a
little.&nbsp; I had succeeded better than I wished, and I had, as
it happened, work nearer at hand.&nbsp; A few days later I called
on Lord Crouchley and carried off in triumph the most
unintelligible statement that had yet appeared of his
lordship&rsquo;s reasons for his change of front.&nbsp; I thus
set in motion in the daily papers columns of virtuous
verbiage.&nbsp; The following week I ran down to Brighton for a
chat, as Mr. Pinhorn called it, with Mrs. Bounder, who gave me,
on the subject of her divorce, many curious particulars that had
not been articulated in court.&nbsp; If ever an article flowed
from the primal fount it was that article on Mrs. Bounder.&nbsp;
By this time, however, I became aware that Neil Paraday&rsquo;s
new book was on the point of appearing and that its approach had
been the ground of my original appeal to Mr. Pinhorn, who was now
annoyed with me for having lost so many days.&nbsp; He bundled me
off&mdash;we would at least not lose another.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
always thought his sudden alertness a remarkable example of the
journalistic instinct.&nbsp; Nothing had occurred, since I first
spoke to him, to create a visible urgency, and no enlightenment
could possibly have reached him.&nbsp; It was a pure case of
profession flair&mdash;he had smelt the coming glory as an animal
smells its distant prey.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>I may as well say at once that this little record pretends in
no degree to be a picture either of my introduction to Mr.
Paraday or of certain proximate steps and stages.&nbsp; The
scheme of my narrative allows no space for these things, and in
any case a prohibitory sentiment would hang about my recollection
of so rare an hour.&nbsp; These meagre notes are essentially
private, so that if they see the light the insidious forces that,
as my story itself shows, make at present for publicity will
simply have overmastered my precautions.&nbsp; The curtain fell
lately enough on the lamentable drama.&nbsp; My memory of the day
I alighted at Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s door is a fresh memory of
kindness, hospitality, compassion, and of the wonderful
illuminating talk in which the welcome was conveyed.&nbsp; Some
voice of the air had taught me the right moment, the moment of
his life at which an act of unexpected young allegiance might
most come home to him.&nbsp; He had recently recovered from a
long, grave illness.&nbsp; I had gone to the neighbouring inn for
the night, but I spent the evening in his company, and he
insisted the next day on my sleeping under his roof.&nbsp; I
hadn&rsquo;t an indefinite leave: Mr. Pinhorn supposed us to put
our victims through on the gallop.&nbsp; It was later, in the
office, that the rude motions of the jig were set to music.&nbsp;
I fortified myself, however, as my training had taught me to do,
by the conviction that nothing could be more advantageous for my
article than to be written in the very atmosphere.&nbsp; I said
nothing to Mr. Paraday about it, but in the morning, after my
remove from the inn, while he was occupied in his study, as he
had notified me he should need to be, I committed to paper the
main heads of my impression.&nbsp; Then thinking to commend
myself to Mr. Pinhorn by my celerity, I walked out and posted my
little packet before luncheon.&nbsp; Once my paper was written I
was free to stay on, and if it was calculated to divert attention
from my levity in so doing I could reflect with satisfaction that
I had never been so clever.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to deny of
course that I was aware it was much too good for Mr. Pinhorn; but
I was equally conscious that Mr. Pinhorn had the supreme
shrewdness of recognising from time to time the cases in which an
article was not too bad only because it was too good.&nbsp; There
was nothing he loved so much as to print on the right occasion a
thing he hated.&nbsp; I had begun my visit to the great man on a
Monday, and on the Wednesday his book came out.&nbsp; A copy of
it arrived by the first post, and he let me go out into the
garden with it immediately after breakfast, I read it from
beginning to end that day, and in the evening he asked me to
remain with him the rest of the week and over the Sunday.</p>
<p>That night my manuscript came back from Mr. Pinhorn,
accompanied with a letter the gist of which was the desire to
know what I meant by trying to fob off on him such stuff.&nbsp;
That was the meaning of the question, if not exactly its form,
and it made my mistake immense to me.&nbsp; Such as this mistake
was I could now only look it in the face and accept it.&nbsp; I
knew where I had failed, but it was exactly where I
couldn&rsquo;t have succeeded.&nbsp; I had been sent down to be
personal and then in point of fact hadn&rsquo;t been personal at
all: what I had dispatched to London was just a little finicking
feverish study of my author&rsquo;s talent.&nbsp; Anything less
relevant to Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s purpose couldn&rsquo;t well be
imagined, and he was visibly angry at my having (at his expense,
with a second-class ticket) approached the subject of our
enterprise only to stand off so helplessly.&nbsp; For myself, I
knew but too well what had happened, and how a miracle&mdash;as
pretty as some old miracle of legend&mdash;had been wrought on
the spot to save me.&nbsp; There had been a big brush of wings,
the flash of an opaline robe, and then, with a great cool stir of
the air, the sense of an angel&rsquo;s having swooped down and
caught me to his bosom.&nbsp; He held me only till the danger was
over, and it all took place in a minute.&nbsp; With my manuscript
back on my hands I understood the phenomenon better, and the
reflexions I made on it are what I meant, at the beginning of
this anecdote, by my change of heart.&nbsp; Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s
note was not only a rebuke decidedly stern, but an invitation
immediately to send him&mdash;it was the case to say so&mdash;the
genuine article, the revealing and reverberating sketch to the
promise of which, and of which alone, I owed my squandered
privilege.&nbsp; A week or two later I recast my peccant paper
and, giving it a particular application to Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s
new book, obtained for it the hospitality of another journal,
where, I must admit, Mr. Pinhorn was so far vindicated as that it
attracted not the least attention.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>I was frankly, at the end of three days, a very prejudiced
critic, so that one morning when, in the garden, my great man had
offered to read me something I quite held my breath as I
listened.&nbsp; It was the written scheme of another
book&mdash;something put aside long ago, before his illness, but
that he had lately taken out again to reconsider.&nbsp; He had
been turning it round when I came down on him, and it had grown
magnificently under this second hand.&nbsp; Loose liberal
confident, it might have passed for a great gossiping eloquent
letter&mdash;the overflow into talk of an artist&rsquo;s amorous
plan.&nbsp; The theme I thought singularly rich, quite the
strongest he had yet treated; and this familiar statement of it,
full too of fine maturities, was really, in summarised splendour,
a mine of gold, a precious independent work.&nbsp; I remember
rather profanely wondering whether the ultimate production could
possibly keep at the pitch.&nbsp; His reading of the fond
epistle, at any rate, made me feel as if I were, for the
advantage of posterity, in close correspondence with
him&mdash;were the distinguished person to whom it had been
affectionately addressed.&nbsp; It was a high distinction simply
to be told such things.&nbsp; The idea he now communicated had
all the freshness, the flushed fairness, of the conception
untouched and untried: it was Venus rising from the sea and
before the airs had blown upon her.&nbsp; I had never been so
throbbingly present at such an unveiling.&nbsp; But when he had
tossed the last bright word after the others, as I had seen
cashiers in banks, weighing mounds of coin, drop a final
sovereign into the tray, I knew a sudden prudent alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear master, how, after all, are you going to do
it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s infinitely noble, but what time it will
take, what patience and independence, what assured, what perfect
conditions!&nbsp; Oh for a lone isle in a tepid sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this practically a lone isle, and
aren&rsquo;t you, as an encircling medium, tepid enough?&rdquo;
he asked, alluding with a laugh to the wonder of my young
admiration and the narrow limits of his little provincial
home.&nbsp; &ldquo;Time isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;ve lacked
hitherto: the question hasn&rsquo;t been to find it, but to use
it.&nbsp; Of course my illness made, while it lasted, a great
hole&mdash;but I dare say there would have been a hole at any
rate.&nbsp; The earth we tread has more pockets than a
billiard-table.&nbsp; The great thing is now to keep on my
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil Paraday looked at me with eyes&mdash;such pleasant eyes
as he had&mdash;in which, as I now recall their expression, I
seem to have seen a dim imagination of his fate.&nbsp; He was
fifty years old, and his illness had been cruel, his
convalescence slow.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if I
weren&rsquo;t all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh if you weren&rsquo;t all right I wouldn&rsquo;t look
at you!&rdquo; I tenderly said.</p>
<p>We had both got up, quickened as by this clearer air, and he
had lighted a cigarette.&nbsp; I had taken a fresh one, which
with an intenser smile, by way of answer to my exclamation, he
applied to the flame of his match.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I
weren&rsquo;t better I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought of
<i>that</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; He flourished his script in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be discouraging, but that&rsquo;s
not true,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that
during the months you lay here in pain you had visitations
sublime.&nbsp; You thought of a thousand things.&nbsp; You think
of more and more all the while.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what makes
you, if you&rsquo;ll pardon my familiarity, so respectable.&nbsp;
At a time when so many people are spent you come into your second
wind.&nbsp; But, thank God, all the same, you&rsquo;re
better!&nbsp; Thank God, too, you&rsquo;re not, as you were
telling me yesterday, &lsquo;successful.&rsquo;&nbsp; If
<i>you</i> weren&rsquo;t a failure what would be the use of
trying?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my one reserve on the subject of your
recovery&mdash;that it makes you &lsquo;score,&rsquo; as the
newspapers say.&nbsp; It looks well in the newspapers, and almost
anything that does that&rsquo;s horrible.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are
happy to announce that Mr. Paraday, the celebrated author, is
again in the enjoyment of excellent health.&rsquo;&nbsp; Somehow
I shouldn&rsquo;t like to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see it; I&rsquo;m not in the least
celebrated&mdash;my obscurity protects me.&nbsp; But
couldn&rsquo;t you bear even to see I was dying or dead?&rdquo;
my host enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead&mdash;passe encore; there&rsquo;s nothing so
safe.&nbsp; One never knows what a living artist may do&mdash;one
has mourned so many.&nbsp; However, one must make the worst of
it.&nbsp; You must be as dead as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I meet that condition in having just
published a book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adequately, let us hope; for the book&rsquo;s verily a
masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the parlour-maid appeared in the door that
opened from the garden: Paraday lived at no great cost, and the
frisk of petticoats, with a timorous &ldquo;Sherry, sir?&rdquo;
was about his modest mahogany.&nbsp; He allowed half his income
to his wife, from whom he had succeeded in separating without
redundancy of legend.&nbsp; I had a general faith in his having
behaved well, and I had once, in London, taken Mrs. Paraday down
to dinner.&nbsp; He now turned to speak to the maid, who offered
him, on a tray, some card or note, while, agitated, excited, I
wandered to the end of the precinct.&nbsp; The idea of his
security became supremely dear to me, and I asked myself if I
were the same young man who had come down a few days before to
scatter him to the four winds.&nbsp; When I retraced my steps he
had gone into the house, and the woman&mdash;the second London
post had come in&mdash;had placed my letters and a newspaper on a
bench.&nbsp; I sat down there to the letters, which were a brief
business, and then, without heeding the address, took the paper
from its envelope.&nbsp; It was the journal of highest renown,
<i>The Empire</i> of that morning.&nbsp; It regularly came to
Paraday, but I remembered that neither of us had yet looked at
the copy already delivered.&nbsp; This one had a great mark on
the &ldquo;editorial&rdquo; page, and, uncrumpling the wrapper, I
saw it to be directed to my host and stamped with the name of his
publishers.&nbsp; I instantly divined that <i>The Empire</i> had
spoken of him, and I&rsquo;ve not forgotten the odd little shock
of the circumstance.&nbsp; It checked all eagerness and made me
drop the paper a moment.&nbsp; As I sat there conscious of a
palpitation I think I had a vision of what was to be.&nbsp; I had
also a vision of the letter I would presently address to Mr.
Pinhorn, breaking, as it were, with Mr. Pinhorn.&nbsp; Of course,
however, the next minute the voice of <i>The Empire</i> was in my
ears.</p>
<p>The article wasn&rsquo;t, I thanked heaven, a review; it was a
&ldquo;leader,&rdquo; the last of three, presenting Neil Paraday
to the human race.&nbsp; His new book, the fifth from his hand,
had been but a day or two out, and <i>The Empire</i>, already
aware of it, fired, as if on the birth of a prince, a salute of a
whole column.&nbsp; The guns had been booming these three hours
in the house without our suspecting them.&nbsp; The big
blundering newspaper had discovered him, and now he was
proclaimed and anointed and crowned.&nbsp; His place was assigned
him as publicly as if a fat usher with a wand had pointed to the
topmost chair; he was to pass up and still up, higher and higher,
between the watching faces and the envious sounds&mdash;away up
to the dais and the throne.&nbsp; The article was
&ldquo;epoch-making,&rdquo; a landmark in his life; he had taken
rank at a bound, waked up a national glory.&nbsp; A national
glory was needed, and it was an immense convenience he was
there.&nbsp; What all this meant rolled over me, and I fear I
grew a little faint&mdash;it meant so much more than I could say
&ldquo;yea&rdquo; to on the spot.&nbsp; In a flash, somehow, all
was different; the tremendous wave I speak of had swept something
away.&nbsp; It had knocked down, I suppose, my little customary
altar, my twinkling tapers and my flowers, and had reared itself
into the likeness of a temple vast and bare.&nbsp; When Neil
Paraday should come out of the house he would come out a
contemporary.&nbsp; That was what had happened: the poor man was
to be squeezed into his horrible age.&nbsp; I felt as if he had
been overtaken on the crest of the hill and brought back to the
city.&nbsp; A little more and he would have dipped down the short
cut to posterity and escaped.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>When he came out it was exactly as if he had been in custody,
for beside him walked a stout man with a big black beard, who,
save that he wore spectacles, might have been a policeman, and in
whom at a second glance I recognised the highest contemporary
enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Morrow,&rdquo; said Paraday, looking, I
thought, rather white: &ldquo;he wants to publish heaven knows
what about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I winced as I remembered that this was exactly what I myself
had wanted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; I cried with a sort of
sense that my friend had fled to me for protection.</p>
<p>Mr. Morrow glared, agreeably, through his glasses: they
suggested the electric headlights of some monstrous modern ship,
and I felt as if Paraday and I were tossing terrified under his
bows.&nbsp; I saw his momentum was irresistible.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was confident that I should be the first in the field.&nbsp; A
great interest is naturally felt in Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s
surroundings,&rdquo; he heavily observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t the least idea of it,&rdquo; said
Paraday, as if he had been told he had been snoring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find he hasn&rsquo;t read the article in <i>The
Empire</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Morrow remarked to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so very interesting&mdash;it&rsquo;s
something to start with,&rdquo; he smiled.&nbsp; He had begun to
pull off his gloves, which were violently new, and to look
encouragingly round the little garden.&nbsp; As a
&ldquo;surrounding&rdquo; I felt how I myself had already been
taken in; I was a little fish in the stomach of a bigger
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;I represent,&rdquo; our visitor continued,
&ldquo;a syndicate of influential journals, no less than
thirty-seven, whose public&mdash;whose publics, I may
say&mdash;are in peculiar sympathy with Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s line
of thought.&nbsp; They would greatly appreciate any expression of
his views on the subject of the art he so nobly
exemplifies.&nbsp; In addition to my connexion with the syndicate
just mentioned I hold a particular commission from <i>The
Tatler</i>, whose most prominent department, &lsquo;Smatter and
Chatter&rsquo;&mdash;I dare say you&rsquo;ve often enjoyed
it&mdash;attracts such attention.&nbsp; I was honoured only last
week, as a representative of <i>The Tatler</i>, with the
confidence of Guy Walsingham, the brilliant author of
&lsquo;Obsessions.&rsquo;&nbsp; She pronounced herself thoroughly
pleased with my sketch of her method; she went so far as to say
that I had made her genius more comprehensible even to
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neil Paraday had dropped on the garden-bench and sat there at
once detached and confounded; he looked hard at a bare spot in
the lawn, as if with an anxiety that had suddenly made him
grave.&nbsp; His movement had been interpreted by his visitor as
an invitation to sink sympathetically into a wicker chair that
stood hard by, and while Mr. Morrow so settled himself I felt he
had taken official possession and that there was no undoing
it.&nbsp; One had heard of unfortunate people&rsquo;s having
&ldquo;a man in the house,&rdquo; and this was just what we
had.&nbsp; There was a silence of a moment, during which we
seemed to acknowledge in the only way that was possible the
presence of universal fate; the sunny stillness took no pity, and
my thought, as I was sure Paraday&rsquo;s was doing, performed
within the minute a great distant revolution.&nbsp; I saw just
how emphatic I should make my rejoinder to Mr. Pinhorn, and that
having come, like Mr. Morrow, to betray, I must remain as long as
possible to save.&nbsp; Not because I had brought my mind back,
but because our visitors last words were in my ear, I presently
enquired with gloomy irrelevance if Guy Walsingham were a
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, a mere pseudonym&mdash;rather pretty,
isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and convenient, you know, for a lady who
goes in for the larger latitude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Obsessions, by Miss
So-and-so,&rsquo; would look a little odd, but men are more
naturally indelicate.&nbsp; Have you peeped into
&lsquo;Obsessions&rsquo;?&rdquo; Mr. Morrow continued sociably to
our companion.</p>
<p>Paraday, still absent, remote, made no answer, as if he
hadn&rsquo;t heard the question: a form of intercourse that
appeared to suit the cheerful Mr. Morrow as well as any
other.&nbsp; Imperturbably bland, he was a man of
resources&mdash;he only needed to be on the spot.&nbsp; He had
pocketed the whole poor place while Paraday and I were
wool-gathering, and I could imagine that he had already got his
&ldquo;heads.&rdquo;&nbsp; His system, at any rate, was justified
by the inevitability with which I replied, to save my friend the
trouble: &ldquo;Dear no&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t read it.&nbsp; He
doesn&rsquo;t read such things!&rdquo; I unwarily added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things that are <i>too</i> far over the fence,
eh?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was indeed a godsend to Mr. Morrow.&nbsp; It
was the psychological moment; it determined the appearance of his
note-book, which, however, he at first kept slightly behind him,
even as the dentist approaching his victim keeps the horrible
forceps.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Paraday holds with the good old
proprieties&mdash;I see!&rdquo;&nbsp; And thinking of the
thirty-seven influential journals, I found myself, as I found
poor Paraday, helplessly assisting at the promulgation of this
ineptitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point on which
distinguished views are so acceptable as on this
question&mdash;raised perhaps more strikingly than ever by Guy
Walsingham&mdash;of the permissibility of the larger
latitude.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve an appointment, precisely in connexion
with it, next week, with Dora Forbes, author of &lsquo;The Other
Way Round,&rsquo; which everybody&rsquo;s talking about.&nbsp;
Has Mr. Paraday glanced at &lsquo;The Other Way
Round&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Morrow now frankly appealed to
me.&nbsp; I took on myself to repudiate the supposition, while
our companion, still silent, got up nervously and walked
away.&nbsp; His visitor paid no heed to his withdrawal; but
opened out the note-book with a more fatherly pat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dora Forbes, I gather, takes the ground, the same as Guy
Walsingham&rsquo;s, that the larger latitude has simply got to
come.&nbsp; He holds that it has got to be squarely faced.&nbsp;
Of course his sex makes him a less prejudiced witness.&nbsp; But
an authoritative word from Mr. Paraday&mdash;from the point of
view of <i>his</i> sex, you know&mdash;would go right round the
globe.&nbsp; He takes the line that we <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> got
to face it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was bewildered: it sounded somehow as if there were three
sexes.&nbsp; My interlocutor&rsquo;s pencil was poised, my
private responsibility great.&nbsp; I simply sat staring, none
the less, and only found presence of mind to say: &ldquo;Is this
Miss Forbes a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Morrow had a subtle smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t
be &lsquo;Miss&rsquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s a wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean is she a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wife?&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Morrow was for a moment as
confused as myself.&nbsp; But when I explained that I alluded to
Dora Forbes in person he informed me, with visible amusement at
my being so out of it, that this was the &ldquo;pen-name&rdquo;
of an indubitable male&mdash;he had a big red moustache.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He goes in for the slight mystification because the ladies
are such popular favourites.&nbsp; A great deal of interest is
felt in his acting on that idea&mdash;which <i>is</i> clever,
isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and there&rsquo;s every prospect of its
being widely imitated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our host at this moment
joined us again, and Mr. Morrow remarked invitingly that he
should be happy to make a note of any observation the movement in
question, the bid for success under a lady&rsquo;s name, might
suggest to Mr. Paraday.&nbsp; But the poor man, without catching
the allusion, excused himself, pleading that, though greatly
honoured by his visitor&rsquo;s interest, he suddenly felt unwell
and should have to take leave of him&mdash;have to go and lie
down and keep quiet.&nbsp; His young friend might be trusted to
answer for him, but he hoped Mr. Morrow didn&rsquo;t expect great
things even of his young friend.&nbsp; His young friend, at this
moment, looked at Neil Paraday with an anxious eye, greatly
wondering if he were doomed to be ill again; but Paraday&rsquo;s
own kind face met his question reassuringly, seemed to say in a
glance intelligible enough: &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m not ill, but
I&rsquo;m scared: get him out of the house as quietly as
possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Getting newspaper-men out of the house was
odd business for an emissary of Mr. Pinhorn, and I was so
exhilarated by the idea of it that I called after him as he left
us: &ldquo;Read the article in <i>The Empire</i> and you&rsquo;ll
soon be all right!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Delicious my having come down to tell him of it!&rdquo;
Mr. Morrow ejaculated.&nbsp; &ldquo;My cab was at the door twenty
minutes after <i>The Empire</i> had been laid on my
breakfast-table.&nbsp; Now what have you got for me?&rdquo; he
continued, dropping again into his chair, from which, however, he
the next moment eagerly rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was shown into the
drawing-room, but there must be more to see&mdash;his study, his
literary sanctum, the little things he has about, or other
domestic objects and features.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t be lying
down on his study-table?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a great interest
always felt in the scene of an author&rsquo;s labours.&nbsp;
Sometimes we&rsquo;re favoured with very delightful peeps.&nbsp;
Dora Forbes showed me all his table-drawers, and almost jammed my
hand into one into which I made a dash!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ask
that of you, but if we could talk things over right there where
he sits I feel as if I should get the keynote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no wish whatever to be rude to Mr. Morrow, I was much
too initiated not to tend to more diplomacy; but I had a quick
inspiration, and I entertained an insurmountable, an almost
superstitious objection to his crossing the threshold of my
friend&rsquo;s little lonely shabby consecrated workshop.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, no&mdash;we shan&rsquo;t get at his life that
way,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The way to get at his life is
to&mdash;But wait a moment!&rdquo;&nbsp; I broke off and went
quickly into the house, whence I in three minutes reappeared
before Mr. Morrow with the two volumes of Paraday&rsquo;s new
book.&nbsp; &ldquo;His life&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; I went on,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m so full of this admirable thing that I
can&rsquo;t talk of anything else.&nbsp; The artist&rsquo;s
life&rsquo;s his work, and this is the place to observe
him.&nbsp; What he has to tell us he tells us with <i>this</i>
perfection.&nbsp; My dear sir, the best interviewer is the best
reader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Morrow good-humouredly protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean
to say that no other source of information should be open to
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other till this particular one&mdash;by far the
most copious&mdash;has been quite exhausted.&nbsp; Have you
exhausted it, my dear sir?&nbsp; Had you exhausted it when you
came down here?&nbsp; It seems to me in our time almost wholly
neglected, and something should surely be done to restore its
ruined credit.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the course to which the artist
himself at every step, and with such pathetic confidence, refers
us.&nbsp; This last book of Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s is full of
revelations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revelations?&rdquo; panted Mr. Morrow, whom I had
forced again into his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only kind that count.&nbsp; It tells you with a
perfection that seems to me quite final all the author thinks,
for instance, about the advent of the &lsquo;larger
latitude.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does it do that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Morrow, who had
picked up the second volume and was insincerely thumbing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everywhere&mdash;in the whole treatment of his
case.&nbsp; Extract the opinion, disengage the answer&mdash;those
are the real acts of homage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Morrow, after a minute, tossed the book away.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah but you mustn&rsquo;t take me for a
reviewer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid I should take you for anything so
dreadful!&nbsp; You came down to perform a little act of
sympathy, and so, I may confide to you, did I.&nbsp; Let us
perform our little act together.&nbsp; These pages overflow with
the testimony we want: let us read them and taste them and
interpret them.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll of course have perceived for
yourself that one scarcely does read Neil Paraday till one reads
him aloud; he gives out to the ear an extraordinary full tone,
and it&rsquo;s only when you expose it confidently to that test
that you really get near his style.&nbsp; Take up your book again
and let me listen, while you pay it out, to that wonderful
fifteenth chapter.&nbsp; If you feel you can&rsquo;t do it
justice, compose yourself to attention while I produce for
you&mdash;I think I can!&mdash;this scarcely less admirable
ninth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Morrow gave me a straight look which was as hard as a blow
between the eyes; he had turned rather red, and a question had
formed itself in his mind which reached my sense as distinctly as
if he had uttered it: &ldquo;What sort of a damned fool are
<i>you</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he got up, gathering together his
hat and gloves, buttoning his coat, projecting hungrily all over
the place the big transparency of his mask.&nbsp; It seemed to
flare over Fleet Street and somehow made the actual spot
distressingly humble: there was so little for it to feed on
unless he counted the blisters of our stucco or saw his way to do
something with the roses.&nbsp; Even the poor roses were common
kinds.&nbsp; Presently his eyes fell on the manuscript from which
Paraday had been reading to me and which still lay on the
bench.&nbsp; As my own followed them I saw it looked promising,
looked pregnant, as if it gently throbbed with the life the
reader had given it.&nbsp; Mr. Morrow indulged in a nod at it and
a vague thrust of his umbrella.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a plan&mdash;a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was an instant&rsquo;s
silence, and then Mr. Morrow made another movement.&nbsp; I may
have been mistaken, but it affected me as the translated impulse
of the desire to lay hands on the manuscript, and this led me to
indulge in a quick anticipatory grab which may very well have
seemed ungraceful, or even impertinent, and which at any rate
left Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s two admirers very erect, glaring at each
other while one of them held a bundle of papers well behind
him.&nbsp; An instant later Mr. Morrow quitted me abruptly, as if
he had really carried something off with him.&nbsp; To reassure
myself, watching his broad back recede, I only grasped my
manuscript the tighter.&nbsp; He went to the back door of the
house, the one he had come out from, but on trying the handle he
appeared to find it fastened.&nbsp; So he passed round into the
front garden, and by listening intently enough I could presently
hear the outer gate close behind him with a bang.&nbsp; I thought
again of the thirty-seven influential journals and wondered what
would be his revenge.&nbsp; I hasten to add that he was
magnanimous: which was just the most dreadful thing he could have
been.&nbsp; <i>The Tatler</i> published a charming chatty
familiar account of Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Home-life,&rdquo;
and on the wings of the thirty-seven influential journals it
went, to use Mr. Morrow&rsquo;s own expression, right round the
globe.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>A week later, early in May, my glorified friend came up to
town, where, it may be veraciously recorded he was the king of
the beasts of the year.&nbsp; No advancement was ever more rapid,
no exaltation more complete, no bewilderment more
teachable.&nbsp; His book sold but moderately, though the article
in <i>The Empire</i> had done unwonted wonders for it; but he
circulated in person to a measure that the libraries might well
have envied.&nbsp; His formula had been found&mdash;he was a
&ldquo;revelation.&rdquo;&nbsp; His momentary terror had been
real, just as mine had been&mdash;the overclouding of his
passionate desire to be left to finish his work.&nbsp; He was far
from unsociable, but he had the finest conception of being let
alone that I&rsquo;ve ever met.&nbsp; For the time, none the
less, he took his profit where it seemed most to crowd on him,
having in his pocket the portable sophistries about the nature of
the artist&rsquo;s task.&nbsp; Observation too was a kind of work
and experience a kind of success; London dinners were all
material and London ladies were fruitful toil.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
one has the faintest conception of what I&rsquo;m trying
for,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;and not many have read three
pages that I&rsquo;ve written; but I must dine with them
first&mdash;they&rsquo;ll find out why when they&rsquo;ve
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was rather rude justice perhaps; but the
fatigue had the merit of being a new sort, while the
phantasmagoric town was probably after all less of a battlefield
than the haunted study.&nbsp; He once told me that he had had no
personal life to speak of since his fortieth year, but had had
more than was good for him before.&nbsp; London closed the
parenthesis and exhibited him in relations; one of the most
inevitable of these being that in which he found himself to Mrs.
Weeks Wimbush, wife of the boundless brewer and proprietress of
the universal menagerie.&nbsp; In this establishment, as
everybody knows, on occasions when the crush is great, the
animals rub shoulders freely with the spectators and the lions
sit down for whole evenings with the lambs.</p>
<p>It had been ominously clear to me from the first that in Neil
Paraday this lady, who, as all the world agreed, was tremendous
fun, considered that she had secured a prime attraction, a
creature of almost heraldic oddity.&nbsp; Nothing could exceed
her enthusiasm over her capture, and nothing could exceed the
confused apprehensions it excited in me.&nbsp; I had an
instinctive fear of her which I tried without effect to conceal
from her victim, but which I let her notice with perfect
impunity.&nbsp; Paraday heeded it, but she never did, for her
conscience was that of a romping child.&nbsp; She was a blind
violent force to which I could attach no more idea of
responsibility than to the creaking of a sign in the wind.&nbsp;
It was difficult to say what she conduced to but
circulation.&nbsp; She was constructed of steel and leather, and
all I asked of her for our tractable friend was not to do him to
death.&nbsp; He had consented for a time to be of india-rubber,
but my thoughts were fixed on the day he should resume his shape
or at least get back into his box.&nbsp; It was evidently all
right, but I should be glad when it was well over.&nbsp; I had a
special fear&mdash;the impression was ineffaceable of the hour
when, after Mr. Morrow&rsquo;s departure, I had found him on the
sofa in his study.&nbsp; That pretext of indisposition had not in
the least been meant as a snub to the envoy of <i>The
Tatler</i>&mdash;he had gone to lie down in very truth.&nbsp; He
had felt a pang of his old pain, the result of the agitation
wrought in him by this forcing open of a new period.&nbsp; His
old programme, his old ideal even had to be changed.&nbsp; Say
what one would, success was a complication and recognition had to
be reciprocal.&nbsp; The monastic life, the pious illumination of
the missal in the convent cell were things of the gathered
past.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t engender despair, but at least it
required adjustment.&nbsp; Before I left him on that occasion we
had passed a bargain, my part of which was that I should make it
my business to take care of him.&nbsp; Let whoever would
represent the interest in his presence (I must have had a
mystical prevision of Mrs. Weeks Wimbush) I should represent the
interest in his work&mdash;or otherwise expressed in his
absence.&nbsp; These two interests were in their essence opposed;
and I doubt, as youth is fleeting, if I shall ever again know the
intensity of joy with which I felt that in so good a cause I was
willing to make myself odious.</p>
<p>One day in Sloane Street I found myself questioning
Paraday&rsquo;s landlord, who had come to the door in answer to
my knock.&nbsp; Two vehicles, a barouche and a smart hansom, were
drawn up before the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the drawing-room, sir?&nbsp; Mrs. Weeks
Wimbush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the dining-room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young lady, sir&mdash;waiting: I think a
foreigner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock, and on days when Paraday
didn&rsquo;t lunch out he attached a value to these appropriated
hours.&nbsp; On which days, however, didn&rsquo;t the dear man
lunch out?&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush, at such a crisis, would have
rushed round immediately after her own repast.&nbsp; I went into
the dining-room first, postponing the pleasure of seeing how,
upstairs, the lady of the barouche would, on my arrival, point
the moral of my sweet solicitude.&nbsp; No one took such an
interest as herself in his doing only what was good for him, and
she was always on the spot to see that he did it.&nbsp; She made
appointments with him to discuss the best means of economising
his time and protecting his privacy.&nbsp; She further made his
health her special business, and had so much sympathy with my own
zeal for it that she was the author of pleasing fictions on the
subject of what my devotion had led me to give up.&nbsp; I gave
up nothing (I don&rsquo;t count Mr. Pinhorn) because I had
nothing, and all I had as yet achieved was to find myself also in
the menagerie.&nbsp; I had dashed in to save my friend, but I had
only got domesticated and wedged; so that I could do little more
for him than exchange with him over people&rsquo;s heads looks of
intense but futile intelligence.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>The young lady in the dining-room had a brave face, black
hair, blue eyes, and in her lap a big volume.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for his autograph,&rdquo; she said when I
had explained to her that I was under bonds to see people for him
when he was occupied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting half
an hour, but I&rsquo;m prepared to wait all day.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether it was this that told me she was
American, for the propensity to wait all day is not in general
characteristic of her race.&nbsp; I was enlightened probably not
so much by the spirit of the utterance as by some quality of its
sound.&nbsp; At any rate I saw she had an individual patience and
a lovely frock, together with an expression that played among her
pretty features like a breeze among flowers.&nbsp; Putting her
book on the table she showed me a massive album, showily bound
and full of autographs of price.&nbsp; The collection of faded
notes, of still more faded &ldquo;thoughts,&rdquo; of quotations,
platitudes, signatures, represented a formidable purpose.</p>
<p>I could only disclose my dread of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most people
apply to Mr. Paraday by letter, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he doesn&rsquo;t answer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
written three times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; I reflected; &ldquo;the sort of
letter you mean goes straight into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know the sort I mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; My
interlocutress had blushed and smiled, and in a moment she added:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he gets many like them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re beautiful, but he burns
without reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t add that I had
convinced him he ought to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he then in danger of burning things of
importance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would perhaps be so if distinguished men
hadn&rsquo;t an infallible nose for nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me a moment&mdash;her face was sweet and
gay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> burn without reading
too?&rdquo;&mdash;in answer to which I assured her that if
she&rsquo;d trust me with her repository I&rsquo;d see that Mr.
Paraday should write his name in it.</p>
<p>She considered a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very well,
but it wouldn&rsquo;t make me see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want very much to see him?&rdquo;&nbsp; It
seemed ungracious to catechise so charming a creature, but
somehow I had never yet taken my duty to the great author so
seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to have come from America for the
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;All alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that that&rsquo;s exactly your
business, but if it will make me more seductive I&rsquo;ll
confess that I&rsquo;m quite by myself.&nbsp; I had to come alone
or not come at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was interesting; I could imagine she had lost parents,
natural protectors&mdash;could conceive even she had inherited
money.&nbsp; I was at a pass of my own fortunes when keeping
hansoms at doors seemed to me pure swagger.&nbsp; As a trick of
this bold and sensitive girl, however, it became romantic&mdash;a
part of the general romance of her freedom, her errand, her
innocence.&nbsp; The confidence of young Americans was notorious,
and I speedily arrived at a conviction that no impulse could have
been more generous than the impulse that had operated here.&nbsp;
I foresaw at that moment that it would make her my peculiar
charge, just as circumstances had made Neil Paraday.&nbsp; She
would be another person to look after, so that one&rsquo;s honour
would be concerned in guiding her straight.&nbsp; These things
became clearer to me later on; at the instant I had scepticism
enough to observe to her, as I turned the pages of her volume,
that her net had all the same caught many a big fish.&nbsp; She
appeared to have had fruitful access to the great ones of the
earth; there were people moreover whose signatures she had
presumably secured without a personal interview.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t have worried George Washington and Friedrich
Schiller and Hannah More.&nbsp; She met this argument, to my
surprise, by throwing up the album without a pang.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t even her own; she was responsible for none of its
treasures.&nbsp; It belonged to a girl-friend in America, a young
lady in a western city.&nbsp; This young lady had insisted on her
bringing it, to pick up more autographs: she thought they might
like to see, in Europe, in what company they would be.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;girl-friend,&rdquo; the western city, the immortal names,
the curious errand, the idyllic faith, all made a story as
strange to me, and as beguiling, as some tale in the Arabian
Nights.&nbsp; Thus it was that my informant had encumbered
herself with the ponderous tome; but she hastened to assure me
that this was the first time she had brought it out.&nbsp; For
her visit to Mr. Paraday it had simply been a pretext.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t really care a straw that he should write his name;
what she did want was to look straight into his face.</p>
<p>I demurred a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why do you require to do
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I just love him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Before I could
recover from the agitating effect of this crystal ring my
companion had continued: &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t there ever been any
face that you&rsquo;ve wanted to look into?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How could I tell her so soon how much I appreciated the
opportunity of looking into hers?&nbsp; I could only assent in
general to the proposition that there were certainly for every
one such yearnings, and even such faces; and I felt the crisis
demand all my lucidity, all my wisdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes,
I&rsquo;m a student of physiognomy.&nbsp; Do you mean,&rdquo; I
pursued, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve a passion for Mr.
Paraday&rsquo;s books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been everything to me and a little more
beside&mdash;I know them by heart.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve completely
taken hold of me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no author about whom
I&rsquo;m in such a state as I&rsquo;m in about Neil
Paraday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to remark then,&rdquo; I presently returned,
&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re one of the right sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the enthusiasts?&nbsp; Of course I
am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there are enthusiasts who are quite of the
wrong.&nbsp; I mean you&rsquo;re one of those to whom an appeal
can be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An appeal?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her face lighted as if with the
chance of some great sacrifice.</p>
<p>If she was ready for one it was only waiting for her, and in a
moment I mentioned it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give up this crude purpose of
seeing him!&nbsp; Go away without it.&nbsp; That will be far
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked mystified, then turned visibly pale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, hasn&rsquo;t he any personal charm?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
girl was terrible and laughable in her bright directness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah that dreadful word &lsquo;personally&rsquo;!&rdquo;
I wailed; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re dying of it, for you women bring it
out with murderous effect.&nbsp; When you meet with a genius as
fine as this idol of ours let him off the dreary duty of being a
personality as well.&nbsp; Know him only by what&rsquo;s best in
him and spare him for the same sweet sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My young lady continued to look at me in confusion and
mistrust, and the result of her reflexion on what I had just said
was to make her suddenly break out: &ldquo;Look here,
sir&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter with him is that if he doesn&rsquo;t look
out people will eat a great hole in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned it over.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any
disfigurement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to speak of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that social engagements interfere with his
occupations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That but feebly expresses it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that he can&rsquo;t give himself up to his beautiful
imagination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s beset, badgered, bothered&mdash;he&rsquo;s
pulled to pieces on the pretext of being applauded.&nbsp; People
expect him to give them his time, his golden time, who
wouldn&rsquo;t themselves give five shillings for one of his
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give five thousand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give your sympathy&mdash;give your forbearance.&nbsp;
Two-thirds of those who approach him only do it to advertise
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed with
the face of an angel.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I
was ever called crude!&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>I followed up my advantage.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady
with him now who&rsquo;s a terrible complication, and who yet
hasn&rsquo;t read, I&rsquo;m sure, ten pages he ever
wrote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My visitor&rsquo;s wide eyes grew tenderer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
how does she talk&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without ceasing.&nbsp; I only mention her as a single
case.&nbsp; Do you want to know how to show a superlative
consideration?&nbsp; Simply avoid him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avoid him?&rdquo; she despairingly breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t force him to have to take account of you;
admire him in silence, cultivate him at a distance and secretly
appropriate his message.&nbsp; Do you want to know,&rdquo; I
continued, warming to my idea, &ldquo;how to perform an act of
homage really sublime?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then as she hung on my words:
&ldquo;Succeed in never seeing him at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never at all?&rdquo;&mdash;she suppressed a shriek for
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more you get into his writings the less
you&rsquo;ll want to, and you&rsquo;ll be immensely sustained by
the thought of the good you&rsquo;re doing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me without resentment or spite, and at the truth
I had put before her with candour, credulity, pity.&nbsp; I was
afterwards happy to remember that she must have gathered from my
face the liveliness of my interest in herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
think I see what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I express it badly, but I should be delighted if
you&rsquo;d let me come to see you&mdash;to explain it
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no response to this, and her thoughtful eyes fell on
the big album, on which she presently laid her hands as if to
take it away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did use to say out West that they
might write a little less for autographs&mdash;to all the great
poets, you know&mdash;and study the thoughts and style a little
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they care for the thoughts and style?&nbsp;
They didn&rsquo;t even understand you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
sure,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;that I do myself, and I dare say
that you by no means make me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had got up to go, and though I wanted her to succeed in
not seeing Neil Paraday I wanted her also, inconsequently, to
remain in the house.&nbsp; I was at any rate far from desiring to
hustle her off.&nbsp; As Mrs. Weeks Wimbush, upstairs, was still
saving our friend in her own way, I asked my young lady to let me
briefly relate, in illustration of my point, the little incident
of my having gone down into the country for a profane purpose and
been converted on the spot to holiness.&nbsp; Sinking again into
her chair to listen she showed a deep interest in the
anecdote.&nbsp; Then thinking it over gravely she returned with
her odd intonation: &ldquo;Yes, but you do see him!&rdquo; I had
to admit that this was the case; and I wasn&rsquo;t so prepared
with an effective attenuation as I could have wished.&nbsp; She
eased the situation off, however, by the charming quaintness with
which she finally said: &ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t want him to
be lonely!&rdquo;&nbsp; This time she rose in earnest, but I
persuaded her to let me keep the album to show Mr. Paraday.&nbsp;
I assured her I&rsquo;d bring it back to her myself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll find my address somewhere in it on a
paper!&rdquo; she sighed all resignedly at the door.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>I blush to confess it, but I invited Mr. Paraday that very day
to transcribe into the album one of his most characteristic
passages.&nbsp; I told him how I had got rid of the strange girl
who had brought it&mdash;her ominous name was Miss Hurter and she
lived at an hotel; quite agreeing with him moreover as to the
wisdom of getting rid with equal promptitude of the book
itself.&nbsp; This was why I carried it to Albemarle Street no
later than on the morrow.&nbsp; I failed to find her at home, but
she wrote to me and I went again; she wanted so much to hear more
about Neil Paraday.&nbsp; I returned repeatedly, I may briefly
declare, to supply her with this information.&nbsp; She had been
immensely taken, the more she thought of it, with that idea of
mine about the act of homage: it had ended by filling her with a
generous rapture.&nbsp; She positively desired to do something
sublime for him, though indeed I could see that, as this
particular flight was difficult, she appreciated the fact that my
visits kept her up.&nbsp; I had it on my conscience to keep her
up: I neglected nothing that would contribute to it, and her
conception of our cherished author&rsquo;s independence became at
last as fine as his very own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Read him, read
him&mdash;<i>that</i> will be an education in decency,&rdquo; I
constantly repeated; while, seeking him in his works even as God
in nature, she represented herself as convinced that, according
to my assurance, this was the system that had, as she expressed
it, weaned her.&nbsp; We read him together when I could find
time, and the generous creature&rsquo;s sacrifice was fed by our
communion.&nbsp; There were twenty selfish women about whom I
told her and who stirred her to a beautiful rage.&nbsp;
Immediately after my first visit her sister, Mrs. Milsom, came
over from Paris, and the two ladies began to present, as they
called it, their letters.&nbsp; I thanked our stars that none had
been presented to Mr. Paraday.&nbsp; They received invitations
and dined out, and some of these occasions enabled Fanny Hurter
to perform, for consistency&rsquo;s sake, touching feats of
submission.&nbsp; Nothing indeed would now have induced her even
to look at the object of her admiration.&nbsp; Once, hearing his
name announced at a party, she instantly left the room by another
door and then straightway quitted the house.&nbsp; At another
time when I was at the opera with them&mdash;Mrs. Milsom had
invited me to their box&mdash;I attempted to point Mr. Paraday
out to her in the stalls.&nbsp; On this she asked her sister to
change places with her and, while that lady devoured the great
man through a powerful glass, presented, all the rest of the
evening, her inspired back to the house.&nbsp; To torment her
tenderly I pressed the glass upon her, telling her how
wonderfully near it brought our friend&rsquo;s handsome
head.&nbsp; By way of answer she simply looked at me in charged
silence, letting me see that tears had gathered in her
eyes.&nbsp; These tears, I may remark, produced an effect on me
of which the end is not yet.&nbsp; There was a moment when I felt
it my duty to mention them to Neil Paraday, but I was deterred by
the reflexion that there were questions more relevant to his
happiness.</p>
<p>These question indeed, by the end of the season, were reduced
to a single one&mdash;the question of reconstituting so far as
might be possible the conditions under which he had produced his
best work.&nbsp; Such conditions could never all come back, for
there was a new one that took up too much place; but some perhaps
were not beyond recall.&nbsp; I wanted above all things to see
him sit down to the subject he had, on my making his
acquaintance, read me that admirable sketch of.&nbsp; Something
told me there was no security but in his doing so before the new
factor, as we used to say at Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s, should render
the problem incalculable.&nbsp; It only half-reassured me that
the sketch itself was so copious and so eloquent that even at the
worst there would be the making of a small but complete book, a
tiny volume which, for the faithful, might well become an object
of adoration.&nbsp; There would even not be wanting critics to
declare, I foresaw, that the plan was a thing to be more thankful
for than the structure to have been reared on it.&nbsp; My
impatience for the structure, none the less, grew and grew with
the interruptions.&nbsp; He had on coming up to town begun to sit
for his portrait to a young painter, Mr. Rumble, whose little
game, as we also used to say at Mr. Pinhorn&rsquo;s, was to be
the first to perch on the shoulders of renown.&nbsp; Mr.
Rumble&rsquo;s studio was a circus in which the man of the hour,
and still more the woman, leaped through the hoops of his showy
frames almost as electrically as they burst into telegrams and
&ldquo;specials.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pranced into the exhibitions on
their back; he was the reporter on canvas, the Vandyke up to
date, and there was one roaring year in which Mrs. Bounder and
Miss Braby, Guy Walsingham and Dora Forbes proclaimed in chorus
from the same pictured walls that no one had yet got ahead of
him.</p>
<p>Paraday had been promptly caught and saddled, accepting with
characteristic good-humour his confidential hint that to figure
in his show was not so much a consequence as a cause of
immortality.&nbsp; From Mrs. Wimbush to the last
&ldquo;representative&rdquo; who called to ascertain his twelve
favourite dishes, it was the same ingenuous assumption that he
would rejoice in the repercussion.&nbsp; There were moments when
I fancied I might have had more patience with them if they
hadn&rsquo;t been so fatally benevolent.&nbsp; I hated at all
events Mr. Rumble&rsquo;s picture, and had my bottled resentment
ready when, later on, I found my distracted friend had been
stuffed by Mrs. Wimbush into the mouth of another cannon.&nbsp; A
young artist in whom she was intensely interested, and who had no
connexion with Mr. Rumble, was to show how far he could make him
go.&nbsp; Poor Paraday, in return, was naturally to write
something somewhere about the young artist.&nbsp; She played her
victims against each other with admirable ingenuity, and her
establishment was a huge machine in which the tiniest and the
biggest wheels went round to the same treadle.&nbsp; I had a
scene with her in which I tried to express that the function of
such a man was to exercise his genius&mdash;not to serve as a
hoarding for pictorial posters.&nbsp; The people I was perhaps
angriest with were the editors of magazines who had introduced
what they called new features, so aware were they that the newest
feature of all would be to make him grind their axes by
contributing his views on vital topics and taking part in the
periodical prattle about the future of fiction.&nbsp; I made sure
that before I should have done with him there would scarcely be a
current form of words left me to be sick of; but meanwhile I
could make surer still of my animosity to bustling ladies for
whom he drew the water that irrigated their social
flower-beds.</p>
<p>I had a battle with Mrs. Wimbush over the artist she
protected, and another over the question of a certain week, at
the end of July, that Mr. Paraday appeared to have contracted to
spend with her in the country.&nbsp; I protested against this
visit; I intimated that he was too unwell for hospitality without
a nuance, for caresses without imagination; I begged he might
rather take the time in some restorative way.&nbsp; A sultry air
of promises, of ponderous parties, hung over his August, and he
would greatly profit by the interval of rest.&nbsp; He
hadn&rsquo;t told me he was ill again that he had had a warning;
but I hadn&rsquo;t needed this, for I found his reticence his
worst symptom.&nbsp; The only thing he said to me was that he
believed a comfortable attack of something or other would set him
up: it would put out of the question everything but the
exemptions he prized.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have
presented him as a martyr in a very small cause if I fail to
explain that he surrendered himself much more liberally than I
surrendered him.&nbsp; He filled his lungs, for the most part;
with the comedy of his queer fate: the tragedy was in the
spectacles through which I chose to look.&nbsp; He was conscious
of inconvenience, and above all of a great renouncement; but how
could he have heard a mere dirge in the bells of his
accession?&nbsp; The sagacity and the jealousy were mine, and his
the impressions and the harvest.&nbsp; Of course, as regards Mrs.
Wimbush, I was worsted in my encounters, for wasn&rsquo;t the
state of his health the very reason for his coming to her at
Prestidge?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it precisely at Prestidge that he
was to be coddled, and wasn&rsquo;t the dear Princess coming to
help her to coddle him?&nbsp; The dear Princess, now on a visit
to England, was of a famous foreign house, and, in her gilded
cage, with her retinue of keepers and feeders, was the most
expensive specimen in the good lady&rsquo;s collection.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think her august presence had had to do with
Paraday&rsquo;s consenting to go, but it&rsquo;s not impossible
he had operated as a bait to the illustrious stranger.&nbsp; The
party had been made up for him, Mrs. Wimbush averred, and every
one was counting on it, the dear Princess most of all.&nbsp; If
he was well enough he was to read them something absolutely
fresh, and it was on that particular prospect the Princess had
set her heart.&nbsp; She was so fond of genius in <i>any</i> walk
of life, and was so used to it and understood it so well: she was
the greatest of Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s admirers, she devoured
everything he wrote.&nbsp; And then he read like an angel.&nbsp;
Mrs. Wimbush reminded me that he had again and again given her,
Mrs. Wimbush, the privilege of listening to him.</p>
<p>I looked at her a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has he read to
you?&rdquo; I crudely enquired.</p>
<p>For a moment too she met my eyes, and for the fraction of a
moment she hesitated and coloured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh all sorts of
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered if this were an imperfect recollection or only a
perfect fib, and she quite understood my unuttered comment on her
measure of such things.&nbsp; But if she could forget Neil
Paraday&rsquo;s beauties she could of course forget my rudeness,
and three days later she invited me, by telegraph, to join the
party at Prestidge.&nbsp; This time she might indeed have had a
story about what I had given up to be near the master.&nbsp; I
addressed from that fine residence several communications to a
young lady in London, a young lady whom, I confess, I quitted
with reluctance and whom the reminder of what she herself could
give up was required to make me quit at all.&nbsp; It adds to the
gratitude I owe her on other grounds that she kindly allows me to
transcribe from my letters a few of the passages in which that
hateful sojourn is candidly commemorated.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I ought to enjoy the joke of what&rsquo;s
going on here,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;but somehow it
doesn&rsquo;t amuse me.&nbsp; Pessimism on the contrary possesses
me and cynicism deeply engages.&nbsp; I positively feel my own
flesh sore from the brass nails in Neil Paraday&rsquo;s social
harness.&nbsp; The house is full of people who like him, as they
mention, awfully, and with whom his talent for talking nonsense
has prodigious success.&nbsp; I delight in his nonsense myself;
why is it therefore that I grudge these happy folk their artless
satisfaction?&nbsp; Mystery of the human heart&mdash;abyss of the
critical spirit!&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush thinks she can answer that
question, and as my want of gaiety has at last worn out her
patience she has given me a glimpse of her shrewd guess.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m made restless by the selfishness of the insincere
friend&mdash;I want to monopolise Paraday in order that he may
push me on.&nbsp; To be intimate with him is a feather in my cap;
it gives me an importance that I couldn&rsquo;t naturally pretend
to, and I seek to deprive him of social refreshment because I
fear that meeting more disinterested people may enlighten him as
to my real motive.&nbsp; All the disinterested people here are
his particular admirers and have been carefully selected as
such.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s supposed to be a copy of his last book
in the house, and in the hall I come upon ladies, in attitudes,
bending gracefully over the first volume.&nbsp; I discreetly
avert my eyes, and when I next look round the precarious joy has
been superseded by the book of life.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
sociable circle or a confidential couple, and the relinquished
volume lies open on its face and as dropped under extreme
coercion.&nbsp; Somebody else presently finds it and transfers
it, with its air of momentary desolation, to another piece of
furniture.&nbsp; Every one&rsquo;s asking every one about it all
day, and every one&rsquo;s telling every one where they put it
last.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s rather smudgy about the
twentieth page.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a strong impression, too, that
the second volume is lost&mdash;has been packed in the bag of
some departing guest; and yet everybody has the impression that
somebody else has read to the end.&nbsp; You see therefore that
the beautiful book plays a great part in our existence.&nbsp; Why
should I take the occasion of such distinguished honours to say
that I begin to see deeper into Gustave Flaubert&rsquo;s doleful
refrain about the hatred of literature?&nbsp; I refer you again
to the perverse constitution of man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Princess is a massive lady with the organisation of
an athlete and the confusion of tongues of a valet de
place.&nbsp; She contrives to commit herself extraordinarily
little in a great many languages, and is entertained and
conversed with in detachments and relays, like an institution
which goes on from generation to generation or a big building
contracted for under a forfeit.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t have a
personal taste any more than, when her husband succeeds, she can
have a personal crown, and her opinion on any matter is rusty and
heavy and plain&mdash;made, in the night of ages, to last and be
transmitted.&nbsp; I feel as if I ought to &lsquo;tip&rsquo; some
custode for my glimpse of it.&nbsp; She has been told everything
in the world and has never perceived anything, and the echoes of
her education respond awfully to the rash footfall&mdash;I mean
the casual remark&mdash;in the cold Valhalla of her memory.&nbsp;
Mrs. Wimbush delights in her wit and says there&rsquo;s nothing
so charming as to hear Mr. Paraday draw it out.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
perpetually detailed for this job, and he tells me it has a
peculiarly exhausting effect.&nbsp; Every one&rsquo;s
beginning&mdash;at the end of two days&mdash;to sidle
obsequiously away from her, and Mrs. Wimbush pushes him again and
again into the breach.&nbsp; None of the uses I have yet seen him
put to infuriate me quite so much.&nbsp; He looks very fagged and
has at last confessed to me that his condition makes him
uneasy&mdash;has even promised me he&rsquo;ll go straight home
instead of returning to his final engagements in town.&nbsp; Last
night I had some talk with him about going to-day, cutting his
visit short; so sure am I that he&rsquo;ll be better as soon as
he&rsquo;s shut up in his lighthouse.&nbsp; He told me that this
is what he would like to do; reminding me, however, that the
first lesson of his greatness has been precisely that he
can&rsquo;t do what he likes.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush would never
forgive him if he should leave her before the Princess has
received the last hand.&nbsp; When I hint that a violent rupture
with our hostess would be the best thing in the world for him he
gives me to understand that if his reason assents to the
proposition his courage hangs woefully back.&nbsp; He makes no
secret of being mortally afraid of her, and when I ask what harm
she can do him that she hasn&rsquo;t already done he simply
repeats: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;m afraid!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t enquire too closely,&rsquo; he said last night;
&lsquo;only believe that I feel a sort of terror.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s strange, when she&rsquo;s so kind!&nbsp; At any rate,
I&rsquo;d as soon overturn that piece of priceless S&egrave;vres
as tell her I must go before my date.&rsquo;&nbsp; It sounds
dreadfully weak, but he has some reason, and he pays for his
imagination, which puts him (I should hate it) in the place of
others and makes him feel, even against himself, their feelings,
their appetites, their motives.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s indeed
inveterately against himself that he makes his imagination
act.&nbsp; What a pity he has such a lot of it!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
too beastly intelligent.&nbsp; Besides, the famous
reading&rsquo;s still to come off, and it has been postponed a
day to allow Guy Walsingham to arrive.&nbsp; It appears this
eminent lady&rsquo;s staying at a house a few miles off, which
means of course that Mrs. Wimbush has forcibly annexed her.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s to come over in a day or two&mdash;Mrs. Wimbush wants
her to hear Mr. Paraday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day&rsquo;s wet and cold, and several of the
company, at the invitation of the Duke, have driven over to
luncheon at Bigwood.&nbsp; I saw poor Paraday wedge himself, by
command, into the little supplementary seat of a brougham in
which the Princess and our hostess were already ensconced.&nbsp;
If the front glass isn&rsquo;t open on his dear old back perhaps
he&rsquo;ll survive.&nbsp; Bigwood, I believe, is very grand and
frigid, all marble and precedence, and I wish him well out of the
adventure.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you how much more and more
your attitude to him, in the midst of all this, shines out by
contrast.&nbsp; I never willingly talk to these people about him,
but see what a comfort I find it to scribble to you!&nbsp; I
appreciate it&mdash;it keeps me warm; there are no fires in the
house.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush goes by the calendar, the temperature
goes by the weather, the weather goes by God knows what, and the
Princess is easily heated.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve nothing but my
acrimony to warm me, and have been out under an umbrella to
restore my circulation.&nbsp; Coming in an hour ago I found Lady
Augusta Minch rummaging about the hall.&nbsp; When I asked her
what she was looking for she said she had mislaid something that
Mr. Paraday had lent her.&nbsp; I ascertained in a moment that
the article in question is a manuscript, and I&rsquo;ve a
foreboding that it&rsquo;s the noble morsel he read me six weeks
ago.&nbsp; When I expressed my surprise that he should have
bandied about anything so precious (I happen to know it&rsquo;s
his only copy&mdash;in the most beautiful hand in all the world)
Lady Augusta confessed to me that she hadn&rsquo;t had it from
himself, but from Mrs. Wimbush, who had wished to give her a
glimpse of it as a salve for her not being able to stay and hear
it read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that the piece he&rsquo;s to read,&rsquo; I
asked, &lsquo;when Guy Walsingham arrives?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not for Guy Walsingham they&rsquo;re
waiting now, it&rsquo;s for Dora Forbes,&rsquo; Lady Augusta
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s coming, I believe, early
to-morrow.&nbsp; Meanwhile Mrs. Wimbush has found out about him,
and is actively wiring to him.&nbsp; She says he also must hear
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You bewilder me a little,&rsquo; I replied;
&lsquo;in the age we live in one gets lost among the genders and
the pronouns.&nbsp; The clear thing is that Mrs. Wimbush
doesn&rsquo;t guard such a treasure so jealously as she
might.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Poor dear, she has the Princess to guard!&nbsp;
Mr. Paraday lent her the manuscript to look over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She spoke, you mean, as if it were the morning
paper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Augusta stared&mdash;my irony was lost on
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;She didn&rsquo;t have time, so she gave me a
chance first; because unfortunately I go to-morrow to
Bigwood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And your chance has only proved a chance to lose
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost it.&nbsp; I remember
now&mdash;it was very stupid of me to have forgotten.&nbsp; I
told my maid to give it to Lord Dorimont&mdash;or at least to his
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And Lord Dorimont went away directly after
luncheon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course he gave it back to my maid&mdash;or
else his man did,&rsquo; said Lady Augusta.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dare
say it&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conscience of these people is like a summer
sea.&nbsp; They haven&rsquo;t time to look over a priceless
composition; they&rsquo;ve only time to kick it about the
house.&nbsp; I suggested that the &lsquo;man,&rsquo; fired with a
noble emulation, had perhaps kept the work for his own perusal;
and her ladyship wanted to know whether, if the thing
shouldn&rsquo;t reappear for the grand occasion appointed by our
hostess, the author wouldn&rsquo;t have something else to read
that would do just as well.&nbsp; Their questions are too
delightful!&nbsp; I declared to Lady Augusta briefly that nothing
in the world can ever do so well as the thing that does best; and
at this she looked a little disconcerted.&nbsp; But I added that
if the manuscript had gone astray our little circle would have
the less of an effort of attention to make.&nbsp; The piece in
question was very long&mdash;it would keep them three hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Three hours!&nbsp; Oh the Princess will get
up!&rsquo; said Lady Augusta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought she was Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s greatest
admirer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I dare say she is&mdash;she&rsquo;s so awfully
clever.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s the use of being a
Princess&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t dissemble your love?&rsquo; I
asked as Lady Augusta was vague.&nbsp; She said at any rate
she&rsquo;d question her maid; and I&rsquo;m hoping that when I
go down to dinner I shall find the manuscript has been
recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It has <i>not</i> been recovered,&rdquo; I wrote early
the next day, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m moreover much troubled about
our friend.&nbsp; He came back from Bigwood with a chill and,
being allowed to have a fire in his room, lay down a while before
dinner.&nbsp; I tried to send him to bed and indeed thought I had
put him in the way of it; but after I had gone to dress Mrs.
Wimbush came up to see him, with the inevitable result that when
I returned I found him under arms and flushed and feverish,
though decorated with the rare flower she had brought him for his
button-hole.&nbsp; He came down to dinner, but Lady Augusta Minch
was very shy of him.&nbsp; To-day he&rsquo;s in great pain, and
the advent of ces dames&mdash;I mean of Guy Walsingham and Dora
Forbes&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t at all console me.&nbsp; It does Mrs.
Wimbush, however, for she has consented to his remaining in bed
so that he may be all right to-morrow for the listening
circle.&nbsp; Guy Walsingham&rsquo;s already on the scene, and
the Doctor for Paraday also arrived early.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
yet seen the author of &lsquo;Obsessions,&rsquo; but of course
I&rsquo;ve had a moment by myself with the Doctor.&nbsp; I tried
to get him to say that our invalid must go straight home&mdash;I
mean to-morrow or next day; but he quite refuses to talk about
the future.&nbsp; Absolute quiet and warmth and the regular
administration of an important remedy are the points he mainly
insists on.&nbsp; He returns this afternoon, and I&rsquo;m to go
back to see the patient at one o&rsquo;clock, when he next takes
his medicine.&nbsp; It consoles me a little that he certainly
won&rsquo;t be able to read&mdash;an exertion he was already more
than unfit for.&nbsp; Lady Augusta went off after breakfast,
assuring me her first care would be to follow up the lost
manuscript.&nbsp; I can see she thinks me a shocking busybody and
doesn&rsquo;t understand my alarm, but she&rsquo;ll do what she
can, for she&rsquo;s a good-natured woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;So are
they all honourable men.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was precisely what
made her give the thing to Lord Dorimont and made Lord Dorimont
bag it.&nbsp; What use <i>he</i> has for it God only knows.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve the worst forebodings, but somehow I&rsquo;m strangely
without passion&mdash;desperately calm.&nbsp; As I consider the
unconscious, the well-meaning ravages of our appreciative circle
I bow my head in submission to some great natural, some universal
accident; I&rsquo;m rendered almost indifferent, in fact quite
gay (ha-ha!) by the sense of immitigable fate.&nbsp; Lady Augusta
promises me to trace the precious object and let me have it
through the post by the time Paraday&rsquo;s well enough to play
his part with it.&nbsp; The last evidence is that her maid did
give it to his lordship&rsquo;s valet.&nbsp; One would suppose it
some thrilling number of <i>The Family Budget</i>.&nbsp; Mrs.
Wimbush, who&rsquo;s aware of the accident, is much less agitated
by it than she would doubtless be were she not for the hour
inevitably engrossed with Guy Walsingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later in the day I informed my correspondent, for whom indeed
I kept a loose diary of the situation, that I had made the
acquaintance of this celebrity and that she was a pretty little
girl who wore her hair in what used to be called a crop.&nbsp;
She looked so juvenile and so innocent that if, as Mr. Morrow had
announced, she was resigned to the larger latitude, her
superiority to prejudice must have come to her early.&nbsp; I
spent most of the day hovering about Neil Paraday&rsquo;s room,
but it was communicated to me from below that Guy Walsingham, at
Prestidge, was a success.&nbsp; Toward evening I became conscious
somehow that her superiority was contagious, and by the time the
company separated for the night I was sure the larger latitude
had been generally accepted.&nbsp; I thought of Dora Forbes and
felt that he had no time to lose.&nbsp; Before dinner I received
a telegram from Lady Augusta Minch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord Dorimont
thinks he must have left bundle in
train&mdash;enquire.&rdquo;&nbsp; How could I enquire&mdash;if I
was to take the word as a command?&nbsp; I was too worried and
now too alarmed about Neil Paraday.&nbsp; The Doctor came back,
and it was an immense satisfaction to me to be sure he was wise
and interested.&nbsp; He was proud of being called to so
distinguished a patient, but he admitted to me that night that my
friend was gravely ill.&nbsp; It was really a relapse, a
recrudescence of his old malady.&nbsp; There could be no question
of moving him: we must at any rate see first, on the spot, what
turn his condition would take.&nbsp; Meanwhile, on the morrow, he
was to have a nurse.&nbsp; On the morrow the dear man was easier,
and my spirits rose to such cheerfulness that I could almost
laugh over Lady Augusta&rsquo;s second telegram: &ldquo;Lord
Dorimont&rsquo;s servant been to station&mdash;nothing
found.&nbsp; Push enquiries.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did laugh, I&rsquo;m
sure, as I remembered this to be the mystic scroll I had scarcely
allowed poor Mr. Morrow to point his umbrella at.&nbsp; Fool that
I had been: the thirty-seven influential journals wouldn&rsquo;t
have destroyed it, they&rsquo;d only have printed it.&nbsp; Of
course I said nothing to Paraday.</p>
<p>When the nurse arrived she turned me out of the room, on which
I went downstairs.&nbsp; I should premise that at breakfast the
news that our brilliant friend was doing well excited universal
complacency, and the Princess graciously remarked that he was
only to be commiserated for missing the society of Miss
Collop.&nbsp; Mrs. Wimbush, whose social gift never shone
brighter than in the dry decorum with which she accepted this
fizzle in her fireworks, mentioned to me that Guy Walsingham had
made a very favourable impression on her Imperial Highness.&nbsp;
Indeed I think every one did so, and that, like the money-market
or the national honour, her Imperial Highness was
constitutionally sensitive.&nbsp; There was a certain gladness, a
perceptible bustle in the air, however, which I thought slightly
anomalous in a house where a great author lay critically
ill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Le roy est mort&mdash;vive le roy&rdquo;: I was
reminded that another great author had already stepped into his
shoes.&nbsp; When I came down again after the nurse had taken
possession I found a strange gentleman hanging about the hall and
pacing to and fro by the closed door of the drawing-room.&nbsp;
This personage was florid and bald; he had a big red moustache
and wore showy knickerbockers&mdash;characteristics all that
fitted to my conception of the identity of Dora Forbes.&nbsp; In
a moment I saw what had happened: the author of &ldquo;The Other
Way Round&rdquo; had just alighted at the portals of Prestidge,
but had suffered a scruple to restrain him from penetrating
further.&nbsp; I recognised his scruple when, pausing to listen
at his gesture of caution, I heard a shrill voice lifted in a
sort of rhythmic uncanny chant.&nbsp; The famous reading had
begun, only it was the author of &ldquo;Obsessions&rdquo; who now
furnished the sacrifice.&nbsp; The new visitor whispered to me
that he judged something was going on he oughtn&rsquo;t to
interrupt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Collop arrived last night,&rdquo; I smiled,
&ldquo;and the Princess has a thirst for the
in&eacute;dit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora Forbes lifted his bushy brows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss
Collop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy Walsingham, your distinguished
confr&egrave;re&mdash;or shall I say your formidable
rival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; growled Dora Forbes.&nbsp; Then he added:
&ldquo;Shall I spoil it if I go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think nothing could spoil it!&rdquo; I
ambiguously laughed.</p>
<p>Dora Forbes evidently felt the dilemma; he gave an irritated
crook to his moustache.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Shall</i> I go in?&rdquo;
he presently asked.</p>
<p>We looked at each other hard a moment; then I expressed
something bitter that was in me, expressed it in an infernal
&ldquo;Do!&rdquo;&nbsp; After this I got out into the air, but
not so fast as not to hear, when the door of the drawing-room
opened, the disconcerted drop of Miss Collop&rsquo;s public
manner: she must have been in the midst of the larger
latitude.&nbsp; Producing with extreme rapidity, Guy Walsingham
has just published a work in which amiable people who are not
initiated have been pained to see the genius of a sister-novelist
held up to unmistakeable ridicule; so fresh an exhibition does it
seem to them of the dreadful way men have always treated
women.&nbsp; Dora Forbes, it&rsquo;s true, at the present hour,
is immensely pushed by Mrs. Wimbush and has sat for his portrait
to the young artists she protects, sat for it not only in oils
but in monumental alabaster.</p>
<p>What happened at Prestidge later in the day is of course
contemporary history.&nbsp; If the interruption I had whimsically
sanctioned was almost a scandal, what is to be said of that
general scatter of the company which, under the Doctor&rsquo;s
rule, began to take place in the evening?&nbsp; His rule was
soothing to behold, small comfort as I was to have at the
end.&nbsp; He decreed in the interest of his patient an
absolutely soundless house and a consequent break-up of the
party.&nbsp; Little country practitioner as he was, he literally
packed off the Princess.&nbsp; She departed as promptly as if a
revolution had broken out, and Guy Walsingham emigrated with
her.&nbsp; I was kindly permitted to remain, and this was not
denied even to Mrs. Wimbush.&nbsp; The privilege was withheld
indeed from Dora Forbes; so Mrs. Wimbush kept her latest capture
temporarily concealed.&nbsp; This was so little, however, her
usual way of dealing with her eminent friends that a couple of
days of it exhausted her patience, and she went up to town with
him in great publicity.&nbsp; The sudden turn for the worse her
afflicted guest had, after a brief improvement, taken on the
third night raised an obstacle to her seeing him before her
retreat; a fortunate circumstance doubtless, for she was
fundamentally disappointed in him.&nbsp; This was not the kind of
performance for which she had invited him to Prestidge, let alone
invited the Princess.&nbsp; I must add that none of the generous
acts marking her patronage of intellectual and other merit have
done so much for her reputation as her lending Neil Paraday the
most beautiful of her numerous homes to die in.&nbsp; He took
advantage to the utmost of the singular favour.&nbsp; Day by day
I saw him sink, and I roamed alone about the empty terraces and
gardens.&nbsp; His wife never came near him, but I scarcely
noticed it: as I paced there with rage in my heart I was too full
of another wrong.&nbsp; In the event of his death it would fall
to me perhaps to bring out in some charming form, with notes,
with the tenderest editorial care, that precious heritage of his
written project.&nbsp; But where was that precious heritage and
were both the author and the book to have been snatched from
us?&nbsp; Lady Augusta wrote me that she had done all she could
and that poor Lord Dorimont, who had really been worried to
death, was extremely sorry.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t have the
matter out with Mrs. Wimbush, for I didn&rsquo;t want to be
taunted by her with desiring to aggrandise myself by a public
connexion with Mr. Paraday&rsquo;s sweepings.&nbsp; She had
signified her willingness to meet the expense of all advertising,
as indeed she was always ready to do.&nbsp; The last night of the
horrible series, the night before he died, I put my ear closer to
his pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thing I read you that morning, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your garden that dreadful day?&nbsp; Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it do as it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been a glorious book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a glorious book,&rdquo; Neil Paraday
murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Print it as it
stands&mdash;beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautifully!&rdquo; I passionately promised.</p>
<p>It may be imagined whether, now that he&rsquo;s gone, the
promise seems to me less sacred.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m convinced that
if such pages had appeared in his lifetime the Abbey would hold
him to-day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve kept the advertising in my own
hands, but the manuscript has not been recovered.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s impossible, and at any rate intolerable, to suppose it
can have been wantonly destroyed.&nbsp; Perhaps some hazard of a
blind hand, some brutal fatal ignorance has lighted kitchen-fires
with it.&nbsp; Every stupid and hideous accident haunts my
meditations.&nbsp; My undiscourageable search for the lost
treasure would make a long chapter.&nbsp; Fortunately I&rsquo;ve
a devoted associate in the person of a young lady who has every
day a fresh indignation and a fresh idea, and who maintains with
intensity that the prize will still turn up.&nbsp; Sometimes I
believe her, but I&rsquo;ve quite ceased to believe myself.&nbsp;
The only thing for us at all events is to go on seeking and
hoping together; and we should be closely united by this firm tie
even were we not at present by another.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
